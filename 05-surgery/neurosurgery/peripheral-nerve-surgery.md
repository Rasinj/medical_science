# Peripheral Nerve Surgery

## Overview

Peripheral nerve surgery involves the operative management of nerve injuries, entrapment neuropathies, and peripheral nerve tumors. The peripheral nervous system has intrinsic capacity for regeneration, but outcomes depend on injury severity, timing of intervention, and surgical technique. Microsurgical repair, nerve grafting, and nerve transfers can restore function after traumatic injury. Decompression procedures alleviate symptoms from chronic entrapment. Understanding nerve anatomy, classification systems, and regeneration principles is essential for optimal surgical outcomes.

## Peripheral Nerve Anatomy and Physiology

### Structural Organization

**Nerve Fiber Components**
- **Axon**: Nerve cell process conducting impulses
- **Myelin sheath**: Schwann cells wrap axon (myelinated fibers) for rapid conduction
- **Endoneurium**: Connective tissue surrounding individual axons

**Fascicular Organization**
- **Fascicle**: Bundle of nerve fibers (axons) surrounded by perineurium
- **Perineurium**: Dense connective tissue sheath, blood-nerve barrier
- **Epineurium**: Outer connective tissue layer surrounding all fascicles

**Vascular Supply**
- Vasa nervorum: Small vessels within epineurium and perineurium
- Longitudinal anastomoses: Robust collateral blood supply
- Relatively resistant to ischemia

### Nerve Fiber Types

**Motor Fibers**
- Alpha motor neurons: Innervate skeletal muscle (voluntary movement)
- Myelinated, rapid conduction

**Sensory Fibers**
- Large myelinated (Aα, Aβ): Proprioception, vibration, fine touch
- Small myelinated (Aδ): Pain, temperature
- Unmyelinated (C fibers): Slow pain, temperature

**Autonomic Fibers**
- Sympathetic and parasympathetic
- Regulate sweat glands, blood vessels, visceral organs

### Nerve Regeneration

**Wallerian Degeneration**
- Distal nerve segment degenerates after injury
- Schwann cells proliferate, form bands of Büngner (guide axon regeneration)
- Macrophages clear myelin debris

**Axonal Regeneration**
- Axon sprouts from proximal stump
- Grows down endoneurial tubes at **1-3 mm/day** (1 inch/month)
- Target reinnervation required for functional recovery

**Factors Affecting Regeneration**
- **Favorable**:
  - Young age
  - Distal injuries (shorter distance to target)
  - Clean, sharp injury (better opposed nerve ends)
  - Early repair (<72 hours for primary repair, <6-12 months for delayed repair)
  - Sensory nerves (better than motor)
- **Unfavorable**:
  - Advanced age
  - Proximal injuries
  - Crush or avulsion injuries
  - Delayed repair (>12 months)
  - Mixed nerves
  - Nerve gap requiring graft

## Nerve Injury Classification

### Seddon Classification (1943)

**Neurapraxia** (Mildest)
- **Mechanism**: Focal demyelination, axon intact
- **Causes**: Compression, traction, ischemia
- **Recovery**: Complete, spontaneous within weeks to 3 months
- **Example**: Saturday night palsy (radial nerve compression from sleeping with arm over chair)

**Axonotmesis** (Moderate)
- **Mechanism**: Axon disrupted, endoneurial tubes intact
- **Causes**: Crush, stretch, prolonged compression
- **Recovery**: Spontaneous, slow (1 mm/day), may be incomplete
- **Wallerian degeneration**: Distal segment degenerates
- **Regeneration**: Axon grows down intact endoneurial tube

**Neurotmesis** (Most Severe)
- **Mechanism**: Complete nerve transection (axon and connective tissue)
- **Causes**: Sharp laceration, avulsion, severe crush
- **Recovery**: No spontaneous recovery, requires surgical repair
- **Wallerian degeneration**: Occurs

### Sunderland Classification (1951) - More Detailed

**Type I**: Neurapraxia (Seddon)
- Focal demyelination
- Complete recovery

**Type II**: Axonotmesis, endoneurium intact
- Axon disrupted, endoneurial tube intact
- Spontaneous recovery (slow)

**Type III**: Axonotmesis, endoneurium disrupted, perineurium intact
- Axon and endoneurial tubes disrupted
- Variable recovery, may require surgery

**Type IV**: Axonotmesis, only epineurium intact
- Fascicles disrupted
- No spontaneous recovery, requires surgery

**Type V**: Neurotmesis (Seddon)
- Complete transection
- Requires surgical repair

**Type VI** (MacKinnon addition):
- Mixed injury (combination of above types in different fascicles)

## Clinical Evaluation

### History

**Mechanism of Injury**
- Sharp laceration, crush, stretch, gunshot, thermal, iatrogenic (surgical complication)
- Time since injury (prognosis, surgical timing)
- Associated injuries (vascular, fractures, tendon)

**Symptoms**
- Motor weakness (specific muscles)
- Sensory loss (numbness, paresthesias)
- Pain (neuropathic pain, causalgia)
- Autonomic changes (sweating, temperature, color)

### Physical Examination

**Motor Examination**
- Strength testing (MRC scale 0-5)
  - 0: No contraction
  - 1: Trace contraction
  - 2: Movement with gravity eliminated
  - 3: Movement against gravity
  - 4: Movement against resistance
  - 5: Normal strength
- Muscle atrophy (chronic denervation)

**Sensory Examination**
- Light touch, pinprick, two-point discrimination
- Assess sensory dermatomes
- **Semmes-Weinstein monofilament testing**: Quantify sensation

**Tinel Sign**
- Tap along nerve course
- Positive: Tingling in distribution of nerve
- Indicates site of nerve regeneration or injury

**Autonomic Examination**
- Sweating (sudomotor function)
- Skin color, temperature

### Electrodiagnostic Studies

**EMG (Electromyography)**
- Needle electrode in muscle
- Assess motor unit potentials
- **Findings**:
  - Acute denervation (2-3 weeks): Fibrillations, positive sharp waves
  - Chronic denervation: Large polyphasic motor units (reinnervation)
  - Normal: Excludes significant axonal injury

**NCS (Nerve Conduction Studies)**
- Stimulate nerve, record response (motor or sensory)
- **Conduction velocity**: Speed of impulse propagation
  - Slow: Demyelination
  - Normal velocity, low amplitude: Axonal loss
- **Distal latency**: Time from stimulus to response
- **Amplitude**: Number of functioning axons

**Timing**
- Delay 3-4 weeks after injury (allow Wallerian degeneration)
- Repeat at 3 months to assess regeneration

### Imaging

**MRI**
- Visualize nerve anatomy, masses, neuromas
- MRI neurography: High-resolution nerve imaging

**Ultrasound**
- Visualize nerve continuity, neuromas, masses
- Real-time, dynamic examination
- Operator-dependent

## Nerve Repair Techniques

### Timing of Repair

**Primary Repair** (Immediate, <72 hours)
- **Indications**: Clean, sharp laceration with minimal tissue loss
- **Advantages**: No nerve retraction, no scarring, easier to identify fascicles
- **Technique**: Microsurgical primary neurorrhaphy

**Delayed Primary Repair** (3-7 days)
- Allow wound bed to stabilize
- Still within window for direct repair without significant retraction

**Secondary Repair** (Weeks to Months)
- Contaminated wounds, significant tissue loss, missed injuries
- **Optimal timing**: 3-6 months (allow maximal spontaneous recovery if incomplete injury)
- **Latest timing**: Up to 12 months (poor outcomes if longer)

**Late Reconstruction** (>12 months)
- Nerve transfer, tendon transfer, free functional muscle transfer (if motor recovery unlikely)

### Surgical Techniques

**Direct Neurorrhaphy (End-to-End Repair)**

**Indications**
- Nerve gap <2-3 cm, tension-free repair possible

**Technique**
1. **Exposure**: Adequate proximal and distal exposure
2. **Debridement**: Trim nerve ends to healthy tissue (fascicles visible, bleeding)
3. **Alignment**: Match fascicles (size, pattern)
   - Use anatomic landmarks (vascular pattern, fascicle size)
4. **Suturing**:
   - **Epineurial repair**: Suture epineurium only (easier, most common)
   - **Group fascicular repair**: Suture individual fascicle groups (more precise, but risk of fascicular damage)
   - **Fibrin glue**: Adjunct to reduce sutures

**Suture Material**
- 8-0 to 10-0 nylon (microsutures)
- Minimal tension (nerve elongates 15-20% without damage)

**Nerve Grafting**

**Indications**
- Nerve gap >2-3 cm
- Tension-free repair not possible
- Segmental nerve loss

**Graft Sources**
- **Autograft** (Gold standard):
  - **Sural nerve**: Most common donor (sensory, expendable)
  - **Medial antebrachial cutaneous nerve**
  - **Lateral femoral cutaneous nerve**
- **Allograft**: Cadaveric nerve (requires immunosuppression, less common)
- **Conduits**: Synthetic or biological tubes (small gaps <3 cm, small diameter nerves)

**Technique**
- Cable graft: Multiple sural nerve segments side-by-side (match diameter of recipient nerve)
- Reverse polarity: Place graft with distal end proximal (prevent axons growing into small branches within graft)
- Suture graft to proximal and distal nerve stumps (epineurial repair)

**Outcomes**
- Inferior to direct repair (two coaptation sites, longer regeneration distance)
- Sensory recovery: 50-70% useful sensation
- Motor recovery: 30-50% useful function

**Nerve Transfer (Neurotization)**

**Indications**
- Proximal nerve injury (long distance to target, poor prognosis)
- Root avulsion (nerve cannot be repaired at injury site)
- Donor nerve expendable, near target muscle

**Concept**
- Sacrifice expendable donor nerve
- Coaptate to distal stump of injured nerve (or directly to muscle)
- Shorter regeneration distance, faster reinnervation

**Common Transfers**
- **Oberlin transfer**: Ulnar nerve fascicle to biceps branch of musculocutaneous nerve (restore elbow flexion after brachial plexus injury)
- **Spinal accessory to suprascapular**: Restore shoulder abduction
- **Intercostal nerves to musculocutaneous**: Restore elbow flexion

**Outcomes**
- Success depends on timing (<6-12 months), proximity to target

**Nerve Conduits**

**Indications**
- Small nerve gaps (<3 cm)
- Small diameter nerves

**Types**
- **Biological**: Vein, artery, collagen, decellularized nerve allograft
- **Synthetic**: Silicone, polyglycolic acid, polycaprolactone

**Technique**
- Bridge nerve gap with conduit
- Suture proximal and distal stumps into conduit
- Axons regenerate through conduit

**Outcomes**
- Similar to nerve graft for short gaps (<2-3 cm)
- Advantage: No donor site morbidity

### Postoperative Management

**Immobilization**
- Splint to prevent tension on repair (3-4 weeks)
- Joint positioned to relax nerve (e.g., elbow flexion for ulnar nerve repair)

**Rehabilitation**
- Early passive range of motion (prevent joint stiffness)
- Progressive strengthening as reinnervation occurs
- Sensory re-education (for sensory nerves)

**Monitoring**
- Tinel sign: Advancing Tinel indicates regeneration (1 mm/day)
- Clinical examination: Motor and sensory recovery
- EMG: Reinnervation potentials (3-6 months)

## Entrapment Neuropathies

- **Advantages**: Simple, effective
- **Disadvantages**: Elbow instability (rare)

**Postoperative Management**
- Splint 1-2 weeks (if transposition)
- Early range of motion
- Avoid strenuous activity 6 weeks

**Outcomes**
- Success: 70-90%
- Better results with mild symptoms (McGowan I-II)
- Motor recovery: Variable if atrophy present
- Recurrence/persistent symptoms: 10-20%

### Thoracic Outlet Syndrome (TOS)

**Anatomy**

## Peripheral Nerve Tumors

### Schwannoma (Neurilemmoma)

**Characteristics**
- Benign tumor arising from Schwann cells
- **Eccentric** to nerve (can be dissected off)
- Encapsulated
- Slow-growing

**Association**
- Sporadic (90%)
- **NF2** (neurofibromatosis type 2): Multiple schwannomas, bilateral vestibular schwannomas

**Clinical Presentation**
- Palpable mass along nerve
- Pain, paresthesias in nerve distribution
- **Tinel sign**: Tap over mass → tingling
- Weakness if large tumor

**Imaging**
- **MRI**: Well-defined, enhancing mass, eccentric to nerve
- **Target sign**: Peripheral high signal, central low signal (T2)

**Treatment**
- **Observation**: Small, asymptomatic tumors
- **Surgical excision**:
  - Microsurgical dissection
  - Nerve preserved (tumor eccentric, can be separated from fascicles)
  - Complete excision (low recurrence)

**Outcomes**
- Excellent
- Nerve function preserved in >90%
- Recurrence rare (<5%)

### Neurofibroma

**Characteristics**
- Benign tumor arising from nerve sheath
- **Within nerve fascicles** (cannot be separated from nerve)
- Non-encapsulated, infiltrative

**Association**
- **NF1** (neurofibromatosis type 1): Multiple neurofibromas, café-au-lait spots, Lisch nodules

**Clinical Presentation**
- Similar to schwannoma
- Plexiform neurofibroma: Multiple nerve branches, "bag of worms"

**Imaging**
- **MRI**: Ill-defined mass, not separable from nerve

**Treatment**
- **Observation**: If asymptomatic
- **Surgical excision**:
  - Requires nerve fascicle sacrifice (tumor within fascicles)
  - May need nerve grafting
  - **Malignant transformation**: 5-10% (especially plexiform neurofibromas)
  - If rapid growth, pain, neurologic decline → biopsy (rule out malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor - MPNST)

**Outcomes**
- Neurologic deficit common after resection (nerve sacrifice)
- Risk of malignant transformation (monitor for changes)

### Malignant Peripheral Nerve Sheath Tumor (MPNST)

**Characteristics**
- Malignant tumor of nerve sheath
- Aggressive, poor prognosis

**Association**
- NF1 (50% of cases)
- Radiation-induced (prior radiation therapy)
- Malignant transformation of neurofibroma

**Clinical Presentation**
- Rapid growth
- Pain
- Neurologic deficit

**Treatment**
- **Wide surgical resection**: Negative margins critical
- **Adjuvant radiation**: Improves local control
- **Chemotherapy**: Doxorubicin-based regimens

**Outcomes**
- Poor: 5-year survival 30-50%
- Local recurrence common (30-50%)
- Metastases (lung, bone)

## Key Points

1. **Seddon classification** of nerve injury: Neurapraxia (demyelination, complete recovery), axonotmesis (axon disrupted, variable recovery), neurotmesis (complete transection, requires repair).

2. **Nerve regeneration** occurs at 1 mm/day (1 inch/month); timing of repair is critical (best <6-12 months for functional recovery).

3. **Direct neurorrhaphy** (end-to-end repair) is preferred if tension-free coaptation possible; nerve grafting required if gap >2-3 cm (sural nerve most common donor).

4. **Carpal tunnel syndrome** is median nerve compression at wrist; presents with nocturnal paresthesias in thumb/index/middle fingers; treated with carpal tunnel release (open or endoscopic).

5. **Cubital tunnel syndrome** is ulnar nerve compression at elbow; presents with paresthesias in ring/small fingers and intrinsic hand weakness; treatment options include in situ decompression or anterior transposition.

6. **McGowan classification** for cubital tunnel syndrome: Grade I (sensory only), Grade II (sensory + mild motor), Grade III (sensory + severe motor with atrophy); Grade III has worse prognosis.

7. **Schwannoma** is eccentric to nerve and can be dissected off while preserving nerve function; neurofibroma is within nerve fascicles and requires nerve sacrifice for resection.

8. **Nerve transfer (neurotization)** sacrifices expendable donor nerve to reinnervate important muscle via shorter distance; indicated for proximal injuries or root avulsions.

9. **Tinel sign** (percussion test) indicates site of nerve injury or regeneration; advancing Tinel sign indicates ongoing axonal regeneration.

10. **Electrodiagnostic studies** (EMG/NCS) should be delayed 3-4 weeks after injury to allow Wallerian degeneration; helpful to confirm diagnosis, localize injury, and assess regeneration.
