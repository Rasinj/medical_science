# Neurosurgery

## Overview
Neurosurgery focuses on the operative management of diseases affecting the central and peripheral nervous systems, including the brain, spinal cord, and peripheral nerves. Neurosurgical conditions range from traumatic injuries and vascular emergencies to tumors, degenerative diseases, and functional disorders. Success requires mastery of neuroanatomy, understanding of intracranial pressure dynamics, and proficiency in microsurgical techniques.

**Content Status**: Complete coverage of neurosurgical emergencies, tumor management, and complex procedures
