# Hydrocephalus

## Overview

Hydrocephalus is characterized by abnormal accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) within the ventricular system, resulting in ventricular enlargement and increased intracranial pressure. It occurs due to imbalance between CSF production and absorption. Management typically involves surgical diversion of CSF through ventriculoperitoneal shunting or endoscopic third ventriculostomy. Understanding CSF dynamics, etiologies, clinical presentations across age groups, and shunt complications is essential for optimal patient care.

## CSF Physiology

### CSF Production and Circulation

**Production**
- **Choroid plexus**: 70% of CSF production (lateral, third, fourth ventricles)
- Ependymal lining, brain interstitium: 30%
- **Rate**: 20-25 mL/hour (500-600 mL/day in adults)
- **Total CSF volume**: 150 mL (adults), 50 mL (neonates)
- CSF replaced 3-4 times daily

**Circulation Pathway**
1. **Lateral ventricles** → Foramen of Monro (interventricular foramen)
2. **Third ventricle** → Aqueduct of Sylvius (cerebral aqueduct)
3. **Fourth ventricle** → Foramina of Magendie (midline) and Luschka (lateral)
4. **Subarachnoid space** → Over cerebral convexities
5. **Absorption** → Arachnoid granulations (into superior sagittal sinus)

**CSF Functions**
- Buoyancy (reduces brain weight from 1400g to 50g)
- Mechanical protection (cushioning)
- Chemical stability (homeostasis)
- Waste removal

### Intracranial Pressure

**Normal ICP**
- Adults: 5-15 mmHg
- Children: 3-7 mmHg
- Infants: 1.5-6 mmHg

**Elevated ICP**
- >20 mmHg sustained

## Classification

### By Mechanism

**Communicating Hydrocephalus**
- CSF flows freely through ventricular system
- **Impaired absorption** at arachnoid granulations
- **Causes**:
  - Post-hemorrhagic (SAH, IVH): Blood products clog granulations
  - Post-infectious (meningitis): Scarring of granulations
  - Post-traumatic
  - Arachnoid granulation dysfunction

**Non-Communicating (Obstructive) Hydrocephalus**
- **Obstruction** within ventricular system
- **Locations**:
  - **Foramen of Monro**: Colloid cyst, tumor
  - **Aqueduct of Sylvius** (most common site): Aqueductal stenosis, tumor, tectal glioma
  - **Fourth ventricle outlets**: Dandy-Walker malformation, tumor, Chiari malformation

**Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus (NPH)**
- Specific form of communicating hydrocephalus
- Normal ICP on lumbar puncture
- **Clinical triad**: Gait disturbance, urinary incontinence, dementia ("wet, wobbly, wacky")

### By Onset

**Congenital**
- Present at birth or develops in early infancy
- **Causes**: Aqueductal stenosis, Chiari malformation, Dandy-Walker malformation, neural tube defects

**Acquired**
- Develops after birth due to secondary cause
- **Causes**: Tumor, hemorrhage, infection, trauma

### By Age

**Infantile** (<2 years)
- Skull sutures open, allows head growth
- Presents with macrocephaly

**Childhood/Adult**
- Skull sutures fused, no head growth
- Presents with increased ICP symptoms

## Clinical Presentation

### Infants (<2 years)

**Signs**
- **Macrocephaly**: Head circumference >95th percentile or crossing percentiles
- **Bulging fontanelle**: Anterior fontanelle tense, pulsations absent
- **Sunset sign**: Downward deviation of eyes (tectum compression)
- **Scalp vein distension**
- **Increased head circumference velocity**
- Irritability, poor feeding
- Developmental delay

**Sutures Open**
- Allows head expansion, compensates for increased ICP
- May have fewer acute symptoms initially

### Children and Adults (Fused Sutures)

**Symptoms of Increased ICP**
- **Headache**: Worse in morning, with Valsalva, improves after emesis
- **Nausea, vomiting**
- **Visual disturbances**: Diplopia (CN VI palsy), blurred vision
- **Altered mental status**: Lethargy, confusion
- **Cushing's triad** (late): Hypertension, bradycardia, irregular respirations

**Signs**
- **Papilledema**: Optic disc swelling (fundoscopy)
- **Abducens nerve palsy** (CN VI): Lateral gaze palsy, diplopia (false localizing sign)
- Upward gaze palsy (Parinaud syndrome, tectal compression)

### Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus (NPH)

**Clinical Triad** (Hakim's Triad)
1. **Gait disturbance** (most common, earliest):
   - Magnetic gait: Feet appear stuck to floor
   - Wide-based, shuffling, slow
   - Difficulty initiating gait
   - Improved after CSF tap
2. **Urinary incontinence**:
   - Urgency → incontinence
   - Frontal lobe dysfunction (loss of inhibition)
3. **Dementia**:
   - Subcortical pattern: Slowed cognition, executive dysfunction
   - Memory relatively preserved (vs. Alzheimer's)

**"Triad develops in reverse alphabetical order"**: Gait, Urinary, Dementia

**Differential Diagnosis**
- Alzheimer's disease
- Parkinson's disease
- Vascular dementia
- Multi-system atrophy

## Diagnostic Evaluation

### Neuroimaging

**CT Head**
- Ventricular enlargement
- **Evans index**: Ratio of maximum frontal horn width to maximum internal skull diameter
  - Normal: <0.3
  - Hydrocephalus: >0.3
- Periventricular lucency: Transependymal CSF flow
- Sulcal effacement (high-pressure hydrocephalus)
- Identify cause: Tumor, hemorrhage, aqueductal stenosis

**MRI Brain**
- Superior anatomic detail
- **T2-weighted**: CSF flow voids in aqueduct (patent vs. stenotic)
- Identify anatomic abnormalities: Chiari, Dandy-Walker
- **MRI flow study**: CSF flow dynamics

**Differences: Hydrocephalus vs. Atrophy**
- **Hydrocephalus**: Ventricular enlargement, effaced sulci, periventricular edema
- **Atrophy (ex vacuo)**: Ventricular enlargement, prominent sulci, no periventricular edema

### NPH-Specific Testing

**Lumbar Puncture (LP) with CSF Removal**
- Remove 30-50 mL CSF via LP
- **High-volume tap test**: Assess gait before and after
- **Positive response**: Improvement in gait (50-70% predictive of shunt response)

**CSF Analysis**
- Opening pressure: Normal (5-15 mmHg) in NPH
- Cell count, glucose, protein: Normal

**Extended Lumbar Drainage**
- Lumbar drain for 3 days, drain 10-15 mL/hour
- Monitor clinical improvement
- **Predictive value**: 90% if improvement during drainage

**CSF Infusion Test** (Resistance to Outflow)
- Measure CSF absorption capacity
- Infusion of saline into lumbar space
- Elevated resistance (>12 mmHg/mL/min): Impaired absorption, predicts shunt response

**Intracranial Pressure Monitoring**
- Continuous ICP monitoring overnight
- Document B-waves (plateau waves, 15-20 minutes duration)
- Predictive of shunt responsiveness

## Management

### Non-Surgical

**Medical Management**
- **Limited role**, temporizing only
- **Acetazolamide** (Diamox): Inhibits CSF production
  - Used in: Pseudotumor cerebri (idiopathic intracranial hypertension)
  - Not effective long-term for hydrocephalus
- **Furosemide**: Reduces CSF production (minimal effect)

**Serial Lumbar Punctures**
- Temporizing in communicating hydrocephalus
- Not definitive treatment
- Risk: Infection, herniation (if mass lesion)

### Surgical Management

#### Ventriculoperitoneal (VP) Shunt

**Most Common Treatment**

**Components**
1. **Ventricular catheter**: Inserted into lateral ventricle (usually right frontal horn)
2. **Valve**: Regulates CSF flow based on pressure
3. **Distal catheter**: Tunneled subcutaneously to peritoneal cavity

**Valve Types**
- **Fixed pressure**: Low, medium, high pressure
- **Programmable**: Adjustable non-invasively with magnet
  - Allows titration without reoperation
  - Setting may change with MRI exposure (check after MRI)
- **Flow-regulated**
- **Anti-siphon devices**: Prevent overdrainage in upright position

**Surgical Technique**

**Ventricular Catheter Placement**
- Entry point: Kocher's point (11 cm posterior to nasion, 3 cm lateral to midline, above superior temporal line)
- Trajectory: Aim toward ipsilateral medial canthus (coronal), external auditory meatus (sagittal)
- Target: Frontal horn of lateral ventricle, anterior to foramen of Monro
- Depth: 5-6 cm from skull surface

**Valve and Distal Catheter**
- Valve placed under scalp
- Tunneling tool to pass catheter subcutaneously (behind ear, down neck, chest, abdomen)
- Peritoneal entry: Open (minilaparotomy) or laparoscopic
- Insert 30-40 cm distal catheter into peritoneal cavity (allows growth in children)

**Postoperative Care**
- Supine initially (prevent overdrainage)
- Shunt series radiographs: Verify catheter continuity and positioning
- Follow-up: Monitor symptoms, head circumference (infants)

**Alternative Distal Sites**
- **Ventriculoatrial (VA) shunt**: Right atrium via internal jugular vein
  - Used if: Abdominal contraindication (infection, adhesions, prior surgeries)
  - Complications: Thrombosis, endocarditis, nephritis
- **Ventriculopleural (VPl) shunt**: Pleural cavity
  - Complications: Pleural effusion, hydrothorax

#### Endoscopic Third Ventriculostomy (ETV)

**Indications**
- **Obstructive (non-communicating) hydrocephalus**:
  - Aqueductal stenosis
  - Tumor obstructing third or fourth ventricle
  - Tectal glioma
- **Contraindication**: Communicating hydrocephalus (ineffective, CSF absorption problem not addressed)

**Advantages Over Shunt**
- No hardware, no shunt malfunction
- Physiologic CSF circulation restored
- Lower long-term complication rate

**Disadvantages**
- **Success rate**: 70-80% (varies by etiology, age)
- Risk: Basilar artery injury, hypothalamic injury, memory disturbance

**Surgical Technique**
- Endoscope inserted into lateral ventricle (Kocher's point)
- Navigate to third ventricle (foramen of Monro)
- Identify floor of third ventricle (thin membrane anterior to mammillary bodies)
- Perforate floor with blunt probe or balloon catheter
- Create fenestration (communicates third ventricle with prepontine cistern)
- CSF bypasses aqueductal obstruction

**ETV Success Score (ETVSS)**
- Predicts success based on:
  - Age: <1 year (lower success), >10 years (higher success)
  - Etiology: Tumor, aqueductal stenosis (higher success); post-infectious, post-hemorrhagic (lower success)
  - Previous shunt: Reduces success rate

**Postoperative Monitoring**
- ICU initially
- Neurologic exams
- CT or MRI: Confirm fenestration patency
- May take days to weeks for symptoms to improve

**Complications**
- **Basilar artery injury** (<1%): Catastrophic, stroke, death
- **Hypothalamic injury**: Diabetes insipidus, electrolyte disturbance
- **Memory disturbance**: Fornix injury
- **Infection** (<1%): Meningitis, ventriculitis
- **Failure** (20-30%): May require shunt

#### Choroid Plexus Coagulation (CPC)

**Indications**
- Rarely used, mostly historical
- Combined with ETV (ETV/CPC) in select cases (pediatric post-hemorrhagic hydrocephalus)

**Technique**
- Endoscopic cauterization of choroid plexus
- Reduces CSF production

**Outcomes**
- Variable success
- Higher complication rate than ETV or shunt alone

## Complications of Shunts

### Shunt Malfunction

**Most Common Complication** (40-50% over lifetime)

**Obstruction**
- **Proximal (ventricular) catheter** (most common site):
  - Choroid plexus ingrowth
  - Cellular debris
- **Valve**: Debris, protein
- **Distal catheter**: Omental wrap, peritoneal adhesions

**Clinical Presentation**
- Symptoms of increased ICP: Headache, nausea, vomiting, lethargy
- Infants: Irritability, bulging fontanelle, emesis
- Acute presentation: Rapid deterioration

**Diagnosis**
- **Shunt series radiographs**: Check catheter integrity (fracture, disconnection)
- **CT head**: Compare ventricular size to baseline
  - Increased ventricular size suggests malfunction
  - **Slit ventricles**: Ventricular size may not change despite malfunction
- **Shunt tap**: Assess flow, measure pressure, send CSF for analysis
  - Slow or absent flow suggests obstruction
  - Elevated pressure

**Treatment**
- **Shunt revision**: Replace malfunctioning component
  - Proximal obstruction: Replace ventricular catheter
  - Distal obstruction: Replace distal catheter
  - Valve malfunction: Replace valve

### Shunt Infection

**Incidence**
- 5-15% (higher in neonates and first month postoperatively)

**Risk Factors**
- Age <6 months
- Prematurity
- Multiple revisions
- Skin colonization (Staphylococcus epidermidis)

**Organisms**
- **Staphylococcus epidermidis** (50-60%): Coagulase-negative staph, biofilm former
- **Staphylococcus aureus** (15-20%)
- Gram-negative bacteria (E. coli, Klebsiella)
- Propionibacterium acnes

**Clinical Presentation**
- **Early** (<1 month): Fever, wound erythema, CSF leak
- **Late** (>1 month): Low-grade fever, malaise, headache, shunt malfunction
- **VA shunt**: Endocarditis, nephritis, septic emboli

**Diagnosis**
- **Shunt tap**: CSF analysis
  - Elevated WBC (>10-20 cells), low glucose, positive Gram stain/culture
  - May take 48-72 hours for culture growth (biofilm, slow-growing organisms)
- Blood cultures (if VA shunt)

**Treatment**
- **Shunt removal**: Remove all hardware (entire shunt)
- **External ventricular drain (EVD)**: Temporary CSF drainage
- **Antibiotics**: IV (vancomycin + ceftriaxone or cefepime) × 10-14 days
  - Tailor to culture results
- **CSF sterilization**: Repeat CSF cultures (from EVD) until sterile × 2-3 consecutive days
- **Shunt replacement**: After CSF sterile and antibiotics completed
  - New location preferred (avoid infected tract)

**Outcomes**
- Success: 85-90% with shunt removal and antibiotics
- Failure: 10-15% reinfection

### Overdrainage

**Mechanism**
- Excessive CSF drainage, especially in upright position (siphoning)

**Clinical Presentation**
- **Slit ventricle syndrome**: Chronic overdrainage → small ventricles, headache
- **Subdural hematoma**: Tearing of bridging veins (ventricular collapse)
- **Subdural hygroma**: CSF collection in subdural space
- Low-pressure headache (orthostatic)

**Diagnosis**
- CT head: Small ventricles, subdural collections

**Treatment**
- Increase valve pressure setting (programmable valve)
- Anti-siphon device
- Ligation or revision of shunt if severe

### Underdrainage

**Mechanism**
- Inadequate CSF drainage despite patent shunt

**Presentation**
- Symptoms of increased ICP despite functioning shunt

**Treatment**
- Lower valve pressure setting (programmable valve)
- Shunt revision to lower-pressure valve

### Abdominal Complications

**Distal Catheter Migration**
- Perforation of abdominal viscus (bowel, bladder)
- Umbilical herniation

**Pseudocyst Formation**
- CSF-filled cyst around distal catheter
- Prevents CSF absorption
- Presentation: Abdominal pain, shunt malfunction
- Treatment: Drain pseudocyst, replace distal catheter (new location or VA shunt)

**Peritonitis**
- Rare, from shunt infection or bowel perforation
- Treatment: Shunt removal, antibiotics, address bowel perforation

## Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus (NPH)

### Diagnosis

**Probable NPH** (Clinical Criteria)
- Age >40 years
- Insidious onset, progression >3-6 months
- Gait disturbance present
- At least one other feature (urinary, cognitive)
- Ventricular enlargement (Evans index >0.3)
- No alternative diagnosis

**Predictors of Shunt Responsiveness**
- Gait disturbance predominant symptom
- Short symptom duration (<2 years)
- Absence of vascular risk factors (HTN, DM, stroke)
- Positive response to high-volume LP or extended lumbar drainage
- Elevated CSF outflow resistance

**Differential Diagnosis**
- Alzheimer's disease: Memory loss prominent, gait late
- Parkinson's disease: Tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia
- Vascular dementia: Stepwise decline, vascular risk factors
- Multi-system atrophy: Autonomic dysfunction, cerebellar signs

### Treatment

**VP Shunt**
- **Programmable valve preferred**: Allows adjustment
- Initial setting: Medium pressure
- Titrate based on clinical response

**Outcomes**
- **Shunt-responsive**: 50-70%
- **Gait improvement**: 70-80% (most responsive)
- **Cognitive improvement**: 50-60% (less responsive)
- **Urinary improvement**: 40-50% (least responsive)
- **Predictors of good outcome**: Positive LP test, short duration, gait predominant

**Complications**
- Similar to other shunt patients
- **Subdural hematoma**: Higher risk (brain atrophy, elderly)

## Special Populations

### Pediatric Hydrocephalus

**Etiologies**
- Congenital: Aqueductal stenosis, Chiari II, Dandy-Walker
- Intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH): Prematurity
- Infection: Meningitis
- Tumor

**Unique Considerations**
- Growth: Distal catheter length (30-40 cm extra for growth)
- Neurodevelopment: Early treatment critical
- Shunt independence: Rare (5-10%), some "outgrow" shunt need

### Posthemorrhagic Hydrocephalus

**Causes**
- Intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH): Prematurity, germinal matrix hemorrhage
- Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH): Aneurysm rupture

**Mechanism**
- Blood products clog arachnoid granulations
- Impaired CSF absorption

**Management**
- **Acute**: Serial LPs, temporary EVD
- **Chronic**: VP shunt (if persistent)

## Key Points

1. **Hydrocephalus** results from imbalance between CSF production and absorption; communicating (absorption problem) vs. non-communicating (obstruction).

2. **Normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH)** presents with triad: gait disturbance (first), urinary incontinence, dementia; high-volume LP test predicts shunt responsiveness.

3. **VP shunt** is most common treatment for hydrocephalus; programmable valves allow non-invasive pressure adjustments.

4. **Shunt malfunction** (40-50% lifetime risk) presents with increased ICP symptoms; proximal (ventricular) catheter obstruction most common site.

5. **Shunt infection** (5-15%) requires complete shunt removal, IV antibiotics until CSF sterile, then shunt replacement at new location.

6. **Endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV)** is effective for obstructive hydrocephalus (aqueductal stenosis, tumor); avoids permanent shunt hardware.

7. **ETV success** is age and etiology-dependent; higher success in older children/adults with aqueductal stenosis or tumor; lower success in infants and post-infectious/hemorrhagic hydrocephalus.

8. **Overdrainage** complications include slit ventricle syndrome and subdural hematoma; managed with increased valve pressure or anti-siphon device.

9. **Evans index** (ratio of frontal horn width to skull diameter) >0.3 indicates ventricular enlargement; helps distinguish hydrocephalus from atrophy.

10. **NPH shunt outcomes**: Gait improvement most responsive (70-80%), cognitive improvement moderate (50-60%), urinary improvement least responsive (40-50%).
