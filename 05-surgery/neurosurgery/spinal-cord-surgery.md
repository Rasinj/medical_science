# Spinal Cord Surgery

## Overview

Spinal cord surgery encompasses the operative management of traumatic injuries, tumors, vascular malformations, and congenital abnormalities affecting the spinal cord. The spinal cord's limited capacity for regeneration makes surgical precision critical. Goals include neural decompression, spinal stabilization, tumor resection, and prevention of secondary injury. Understanding spinal anatomy, cord perfusion, and intraoperative monitoring techniques is essential for optimal outcomes while minimizing neurologic morbidity.

## Spinal Cord Anatomy

### Gross Anatomy

**Spinal Cord Segments**
- **Cervical**: C1-C8 nerve roots, 8 segments
- **Thoracic**: T1-T12, 12 segments
- **Lumbar**: L1-L5, 5 segments
- **Sacral**: S1-S5, 5 segments
- **Coccygeal**: 1 segment

**Key Landmarks**
- **Conus medullaris**: Terminal end of spinal cord (L1-L2 level)
- **Cauda equina**: Nerve roots below conus
- **Filum terminale**: Fibrous extension from conus to coccyx

### Cross-Sectional Anatomy

**Gray Matter** (Butterfly Shape)
- **Dorsal horn**: Sensory processing
- **Ventral horn**: Motor neurons
- **Lateral horn** (T1-L2): Sympathetic neurons

**White Matter Tracts**
- **Dorsal columns** (posterior): Proprioception, vibration, fine touch
  - Fasciculus gracilis (medial, lower body)
  - Fasciculus cuneatus (lateral, upper body)
- **Lateral corticospinal tract**: Voluntary motor control (contralateral)
- **Spinothalamic tract** (anterolateral): Pain and temperature (contralateral)
- **Dorsal spinocerebellar tract**: Proprioception to cerebellum (ipsilateral)

### Vascular Supply

**Arterial Supply**
- **Anterior spinal artery**: Anterior 2/3 of cord
  - Single vessel, vulnerable to ischemia
  - Supplies corticospinal tracts, spinothalamic tracts, ventral horn
- **Paired posterior spinal arteries**: Posterior 1/3 of cord
  - Supply dorsal columns
- **Radicular arteries**: Segmental feeders
  - **Artery of Adamkiewicz**: Largest radicular artery (T9-L2, usually left)
  - Critical for cord perfusion, injury causes paraplegia

**Venous Drainage**
- Anterior and posterior spinal veins
- Radicular veins
- Epidural venous plexus (Batson's plexus)

## Spinal Cord Injury

### Classification

**ASIA Impairment Scale** (American Spinal Injury Association)
- **A (Complete)**: No motor or sensory function in S4-S5
- **B (Incomplete)**: Sensory but no motor function below injury level, including S4-S5
- **C (Incomplete)**: Motor function below injury level, >50% key muscles grade <3
- **D (Incomplete)**: Motor function below injury level, ≥50% key muscles grade ≥3
- **E (Normal)**: Normal motor and sensory function

**Neurological Level**
- Most caudal segment with normal motor and sensory function bilaterally

**Complete vs. Incomplete Injury**
- **Complete**: No sacral sparing (no sensation or motor in S4-S5, no anal contraction)
- **Incomplete**: Sacral sparing present

### Spinal Cord Injury Syndromes

**Central Cord Syndrome**

- Anatomy: Anterior 2/3 of cord (corticospinal, spinothalamic tracts)
- Presentation:
  - Complete motor paralysis below level
  - Loss of pain and temperature sensation
  - Preserved proprioception and vibration (dorsal columns intact)
- Prognosis: Poor, 10-20% motor recovery

**Brown-Séquard Syndrome** (Hemicord Syndrome)
- Mechanism: Penetrating trauma, hemisection of cord
- Anatomy: Half of cord (unilateral)
- Presentation:
  - Ipsilateral motor paralysis and loss of proprioception/vibration (below level)

### Acute Management

**Prehospital Care**
- Spinal immobilization (cervical collar, backboard)
- Avoid hypotension and hypoxia (secondary injury)

**Emergency Department**
- **ATLS protocol**: Airway, breathing, circulation
- Maintain MAP >85-90 mmHg for 7 days (spinal cord perfusion)
- Avoid hypoxia (oxygen saturation >95%)
- Neurological examination: ASIA scale
- Imaging: CT spine (fractures), MRI spine (cord injury, hematoma, ligamentous injury)

**Methylprednisolone** (Controversial)
- Historic use: High-dose within 8 hours of injury
- **Current evidence**: No clear benefit, possible harm (infection, GI bleeding)
- **Guidelines**: Not recommended as standard of care

### Imaging

**CT Spine**
- Evaluate bony injury: Fractures, alignment, canal compromise
- Fast, available in trauma settings

**MRI Spine**
- **Indications**: Neurological deficit, unexplained pain, concern for ligamentous injury
- **Findings**:
  - Cord edema (T2 hyperintensity)
  - Cord hemorrhage (hematomyelia): T2 hypointensity, worse prognosis
  - Epidural hematoma
  - Ligamentous injury (STIR sequence)
  - Disc herniation

### Surgical Indications

**Emergent Surgery**

- Progressive neurological deterioration
- Spinal instability
- Penetrating injury with CSF leak or retained foreign body

**Timing**
- **Early decompression** (<24 hours): May improve outcomes in incomplete injuries
- No benefit demonstrated for complete injuries, but stabilization indicated

**Spinal Stability Assessment**
- **Three-column concept** (Denis):
  - Anterior column: Anterior longitudinal ligament, anterior vertebral body
  - Middle column: Posterior vertebral body, posterior longitudinal ligament
  - Posterior column: Pedicles, facets, lamina, spinous process, ligaments
- **Instability**: ≥2 columns disrupted

### Surgical Techniques

**Decompression**
- **Laminectomy**: Remove lamina, decompress posterior
- **Corpectomy**: Remove vertebral body, decompress anterior
- **Discectomy**: Remove herniated disc

**Stabilization**
- **Anterior approach**: Cervical (ACDF, corpectomy with cage and plate)
- **Posterior approach**: Pedicle screws and rods, lateral mass screws (cervical)
- **Circumferential**: Combined anterior and posterior (severe instability)

### Postoperative Management

**ICU Care**
- MAP goal: 85-90 mmHg × 7 days
- Respiratory support (cervical injuries, especially C3-C5 affect diaphragm)
- DVT prophylaxis (SCDs early, pharmacologic after 72 hours if no contraindication)
- Pressure ulcer prevention

**Rehabilitation**
- Early mobilization
- Physical and occupational therapy
- Bowel and bladder management
- Psychological support

### Complications

**Neurologic Worsening**
- Epidural hematoma, CSF leak, cord injury from manipulation

**Spinal Shock**
- Temporary loss of all reflexes below injury (flaccid paralysis, areflexia)
- Lasts days to weeks
- **Bulbocavernosus reflex return**: End of spinal shock

**Autonomic Dysreflexia**
- Injuries above T6
- Exaggerated sympathetic response to noxious stimulus (bladder distension, bowel impaction)
- **Presentation**: Severe hypertension, bradycardia, headache, flushing
- **Treatment**: Remove stimulus, sitting position, antihypertensives if needed

### Outcomes

- **Complete injuries** (ASIA A): <5% conversion to incomplete
- **Incomplete injuries**: Variable recovery, depends on syndrome type and severity
- **Motor recovery**: Majority occurs within first 6 months
- **Sacral sparing**: Positive prognostic sign

## Intramedullary Spinal Cord Tumors

### Epidemiology

- Neurophysiologic monitoring critical

**Approach**
- Posterior midline approach
- **Laminectomy or laminoplasty**: Expose involved levels (may need multiple levels)
- **Myelotomy**: Midline dorsal incision through posterior median sulcus (safe entry zone)
- **Tumor Resection**:
  - **Ependymoma**: Dissection plane exists, attempt gross total resection (GTR)
  - **Astrocytoma**: Infiltrative, no clear plane, debulking only (avoid neurological deficit)
  - **Hemangioblastoma**: Resect nodule (vascular, control bleeding)
- **Closure**: Dural closure (watertight), layered

**Intraoperative Monitoring**

- Decline in signals → stop manipulation, irrigation, wait for recovery
- May use cortical mapping in awake patient (rare)

### Postoperative Management

- ICU monitoring initially
- Early mobilization
- Wound care
- Physical therapy
- Serial MRI: Assess extent of resection, recurrence surveillance

### Complications

- **Neurological deficit** (10-30%): Motor weakness, sensory loss (may be transient)

- **Infection** (2-5%): Meningitis, wound infection
- **Spinal deformity**: Kyphosis (especially children after extensive laminectomy)

### Adjuvant Therapy

**Radiation**
- **Ependymoma**: If subtotal resection or recurrence
- **Astrocytoma**: Often used for high-grade tumors
- **Hemangioblastoma**: Rarely needed after GTR

**Chemotherapy**
- Limited role in spinal cord tumors
- High-grade astrocytomas: May use (temozolomide)

### Outcomes

**Ependymoma**
- **GTR**: 80-90% 5-year survival, low recurrence
- **STR**: Higher recurrence, may require radiation
- Functional outcomes: 70-80% maintain or improve function

**Astrocytoma**
- **Low-grade**: 5-year survival 60-80%
- **High-grade**: 5-year survival <30%
- Functional outcomes: Variable, depends on extent of resection and baseline function

**Hemangioblastoma**
- **GTR**: Excellent outcomes, low recurrence
- **VHL patients**: Multiple tumors, recurrence common (surveillance MRI)

## Intradural Extramedullary Tumors

### Schwannoma and Neurofibroma

**Schwannoma**
- Arise from Schwann cells of nerve root
- **Eccentric** to nerve, can be dissected off (nerve preserved)
- Encapsulated
- Sporadic or associated with neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2)

**Neurofibroma**
- Arise from nerve sheath
- **Within** nerve fascicles, cannot be separated
- Associated with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1)

- Functional improvement in 70-80%

## Syringomyelia

### Definition and Pathophysiology

**Syringomyelia**
- Fluid-filled cavity (syrinx) within spinal cord
- Progressive cavitation destroys gray and white matter

**Etiology**
- **Post-traumatic** (30%): Most common, develops months to years after spinal cord injury
- **Chiari malformation Type I** (30%): Cerebellar tonsil herniation obstructs CSF flow
- **Tumor-associated** (10%): Ependymoma, astrocytoma, hemangioblastoma
- **Infection/inflammation**: Arachnoiditis
- **Idiopathic** (20%)

**Pathophysiology**
- Obstruction of CSF flow → pressure gradient
- CSF enters spinal cord through perivascular spaces
- Syrinx expands over time, dissects cord tissue

### Clinical Presentation

**Symptoms** (Insidious, Progressive)
- **Dissociated sensory loss**: Loss of pain and temperature (spinothalamic decussation in central cord)
  - Preserved proprioception and vibration (dorsal columns)
  - **Cape-like distribution**: Upper extremity, shoulders
- Motor weakness (hands → arms → legs)
- **Charcot joint**: Painless joint destruction (loss of proprioception)
- Scoliosis (children)
- Horner syndrome (sympathetic involvement)

**Physical Examination**
- Sensory level: Pain/temperature loss, proprioception intact
- Muscle atrophy (hands, intrinsic muscles)
- Weakness
- Hyperreflexia, Babinski sign

### Diagnostic Evaluation

**MRI Spine** (Entire Spine)
- **T2-weighted**: Syrinx appears as CSF-intensity cavity within cord
- Cord expansion
- Identify cause: Chiari malformation, tumor, arachnoiditis

**MRI Brain**
- Rule out Chiari malformation

### Management

**Observation**
- Asymptomatic, stable syrinx
- No underlying correctable cause

**Surgical Indications**
- Progressive neurological deficit
- Symptomatic syrinx
- Identifiable cause requiring treatment

### Surgical Techniques

**Treat Underlying Cause**
- **Chiari malformation**: Posterior fossa decompression (suboccipital craniectomy, C1 laminectomy, duraplasty)
- **Tumor**: Tumor resection (often results in syrinx collapse)
- **Arachnoiditis**: Lysis of adhesions

**Syrinx Drainage** (If Persistent After Treating Cause)

**Syringopleural or Syringoperitoneal Shunt**
- Small catheter inserted into syrinx, tunneled to pleural or peritoneal cavity
- Drains syrinx fluid
- Risk: Shunt malfunction, infection, neurological injury

**Syringosubarachnoid Shunt**
- Connect syrinx to subarachnoid space
- Restore CSF dynamics

### Postoperative Management

- Neurologic monitoring
- Serial MRI: Assess syrinx size
- Long-term follow-up (syrinx may recur)

### Complications

- Neurological worsening (10-20%)
- Shunt malfunction (20-30%)
- Infection
- Syrinx recurrence (10-30%)

### Outcomes

- Symptom stabilization: 60-80%
- Improvement: 30-50%
- Progression despite surgery: 10-20%
- Pain relief less reliable than motor/sensory stabilization

## Tethered Cord Syndrome

### Definition and Pathophysiology

**Tethered Cord**
- Abnormal fixation of spinal cord preventing normal ascent with growth
- Conus medullaris located below L2-L3 (normal)
- **Stretch injury**: Traction damages cord

**Etiology**
- **Congenital**: Lipomyelomeningocele, tight filum terminale, dermal sinus, split cord malformation (diastematomyelia)
- **Acquired**: Post-surgical scarring, spinal trauma

### Clinical Presentation

**Pediatric**
- Progressive leg weakness, foot deformities
- Gait disturbance
- Bowel/bladder dysfunction (urinary incontinence, retention)
- Back pain (lower)
- **Cutaneous stigmata**: Hairy patch, dimple, lipoma, hemangioma (overlying lumbosacral spine)

**Adult**
- Back pain, leg pain
- Urinary urgency, incontinence
- Sexual dysfunction

**Progressive with Growth**
- Symptoms worsen during growth spurts

### Diagnostic Evaluation

**MRI Spine**
- **Conus position**: Below L2-L3 (abnormal)
- **Thick filum terminale**: >2 mm diameter
- Lipoma, syrinx, diastematomyelia
- Tethered cord adhesions

### Surgical Indications

- Progressive neurological symptoms
- Bowel/bladder dysfunction
- Pain

### Surgical Technique: Tethered Cord Release

**Approach**
- Laminectomy at level of conus
- Identify conus and filum terminale
- **Sectioning filum terminale**: Divide filum (no neural elements, safe)
- **Lysis of adhesions**: Free cord from surrounding scar/lipoma
- Release cord tension
- Duraplasty if dura opened

**Complications**
- CSF leak
- Infection
- Neurological deficit (rare)
- Re-tethering (10-20%)

### Outcomes

- Symptom stabilization: 80-90%
- Improvement: 50-70% (better in children)
- Pain relief: Variable (50-60%)
- Bowel/bladder function: Improvement in 40-60%

## Key Points

1. **Central cord syndrome** is most common incomplete spinal cord injury syndrome; upper extremity weakness worse than lower, best prognosis for recovery (50-70% ambulatory).

2. **Cauda equina syndrome** is a surgical emergency; decompression within 48 hours optimizes recovery of bladder/bowel function and motor function.

3. **Early decompression** (<24 hours) after acute spinal cord injury may improve outcomes in incomplete injuries; maintain MAP 85-90 mmHg × 7 days for spinal cord perfusion.

4. **Ependymoma** is the most common intramedullary spinal cord tumor (60%); gross total resection is goal and achievable due to well-defined plane, excellent prognosis.

5. **Astrocytoma** (30% of intramedullary tumors) is infiltrative without clear dissection plane; debulking only to avoid neurological deficit.

6. **Intraoperative neuromonitoring** (SSEPs, MEPs) is essential during intramedullary tumor resection to prevent neurological injury; decline in signals requires stopping manipulation.

7. **Schwannomas** are eccentric to nerve and can usually be dissected off while preserving nerve function; neurofibromas arise within nerve and may require sacrifice.

8. **Syringomyelia** presents with dissociated sensory loss (pain/temperature loss, proprioception preserved); treatment addresses underlying cause (Chiari decompression, tumor resection).

9. **Tethered cord syndrome** presents with progressive neurological deterioration during growth; surgical release (filum terminale sectioning) stabilizes symptoms in 80-90%.

10. **Artery of Adamkiewicz** (T9-L2, usually left) is critical radicular artery supplying anterior spinal artery; injury during thoracoabdominal surgery causes paraplegia.
