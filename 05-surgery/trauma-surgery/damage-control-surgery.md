# Damage Control Surgery

## Overview

Damage control surgery represents a paradigm shift in trauma care, prioritizing survival over definitive repair in critically injured patients. This staged approach abbreviates the initial operation to control hemorrhage and contamination, accepts temporary closure, and defers definitive reconstruction until physiologic recovery occurs. The concept emerged from recognition that prolonged operations in patients with the "lethal triad" (hypothermia, acidosis, coagulopathy) result in intraoperative death. Modern damage control embraces abbreviated surgery, intensive resuscitation, and planned reoperation, improving survival in the most severely injured.

## Historical Development

**Evolution**:
- **1980s**: Recognition that prolonged surgery in unstable patients causes death on OR table
- **1993**: Stone et al. coined term "damage control" (naval warfare analogy - seal ship, prevent sinking, repair later)
- **Present**: Standard of care for severely injured patients

**Concept**: "It's better to be alive with an open abdomen than dead with a closed one"

## Indications

### Physiologic Criteria

**Lethal Triad**:
1. **Hypothermia**: Core temperature <35°C (94°F)
   - Impairs coagulation (enzyme dysfunction)
   - Exacerbates acidosis
2. **Acidosis**: pH <7.2 or base deficit >15
   - Tissue hypoperfusion, shock
   - Myocardial depression, vasodilation
3. **Coagulopathy**: INR >1.5, PTT >1.5x normal, fibrinogen <100-150mg/dL
   - Trauma-induced coagulopathy (consumption, dilution, dysfunction)

**Presence of ≥1 component → Consider damage control**

### Injury-Based Criteria

**High-Risk Injuries**:
- **Multiple injuries** requiring ≥2 body cavities (thoracoabdominal)
- **Major abdominal vascular injury**: Suprarenal aorta, IVC, major hepatic veins
- **Severe liver injury**: Grade IV-V with hemorrhage
- **Pelvic fracture** with retroperitoneal hemorrhage
- **Pancreaticoduodenal injuries** requiring complex reconstruction

### Resuscitation Criteria

- **Massive transfusion**: ≥10 units RBC anticipated or transfused
- **Persistent hypotension**: SBP <90 despite resuscitation
- **Delayed presentation**: Prolonged prehospital time, delayed recognition

### Timing Criteria

**Operative duration** >90 minutes with ongoing physiologic deterioration

## Three Phases of Damage Control

### Phase I: Abbreviated Laparotomy (OR)

**Goal**: Control hemorrhage and contamination, FAST operation

**Time limit**: <60-90 minutes (minimize OR time)

**Steps**:

**1. Rapid Hemorrhage Control**:
- **Pack**: Four-quadrant packing (laparotomy pads in all 4 quadrants)
  - Perihepatic, perisplenic, pelvis, paracolic gutters
  - Apply pressure (compress liver between pads, tamponade)
- **Identify sources**: Systematically examine once initial control achieved
- **Definitive hemorrhage control**:
  - **Vessels**: Ligate (if non-essential), shunt (if essential), or quick repair
  - **Solid organs**: Pack (liver, spleen), do NOT pursue complex hepatorrhaphy/splenorrhaphy
  - **Splenectomy**: If splenic injury, quick splenectomy (don't attempt repair)
  - **Nephrectomy**: Shattered kidney (don't attempt repair)

**2. Control Contamination**:
- **Bowel injuries**: Staple ends (do NOT perform anastomosis)
  - Resect devitalized bowel, staple proximal and distal ends
  - Leave as discontinuity (restore continuity at reoperation)
- **Gastric, duodenal perforations**: Simple closure or staple
- **Bile duct injuries**: Ligate, drain (ERCP/reconstruction later)
- **Urinary**: Ligate ureter, bladder (drain, repair later)

**3. Temporary Abdominal Closure (TAC)**:
- Do NOT attempt fascial closure (increases intra-abdominal pressure, abdominal compartment syndrome risk)
- **Options**:
  - **Vacuum-assisted closure (VAC)**: Perforated plastic sheet over bowel, moist towels, suction drains, adhesive drape (most common)
  - **Bogota bag**: Sterile plastic sheet (IV bag) sutured to fascia
  - **Barker's vacuum pack**: Towels, drape, suction
  - **Mesh**: Absorbable or permanent mesh (temporary fascial closure)

**What NOT to Do** (defer to later):
- Formal bowel anastomosis
- Complex pancreatic/biliary reconstruction
- Formal vascular repair (if shunt placed)
- Definitive fascial closure

### Phase II: Intensive Care Unit Resuscitation

**Goal**: Restore physiology (correct lethal triad)

**Duration**: 24-48 hours (until physiology normalized)

**Resuscitation Priorities**:

**1. Warming**:
- **Target**: Core temp >36°C
- **Methods**: Warm room, warm IV fluids, forced-air warming (Bair Hugger), warm peritoneal lavage

**2. Correct Acidosis**:
- **Improve perfusion**: Adequate resuscitation (normalize lactate, base deficit)
- **Mechanical ventilation**: Normalize PaCO2
- **Avoid**: Bicarbonate administration (rarely beneficial, may worsen intracellular acidosis)

**3. Correct Coagulopathy**:
- **Balanced resuscitation**: 1:1:1 ratio (RBC:FFP:Platelets)
- **Cryoprecipitate**: Fibrinogen <100-150mg/dL
- **Tranexamic acid**: If not given initially (within 3 hours of injury)
- **Recombinant Factor VIIa**: Adjunct if refractory coagulopathy (off-label, expensive)
- **Goal**: INR <1.5, PTT <1.5x normal, platelets >50,000-100,000, fibrinogen >150-200mg/dL

**4. Resuscitation**:
- **Permissive hypotension initially**: SBP 80-90 (avoid exacerbating hemorrhage before surgical control)
- **After hemorrhage control**: Goal MAP >65, SBP >90-100
- **Blood products**: Massive transfusion protocol, minimize crystalloid
- **Vasopressors**: Norepinephrine if persistent hypotension after volume resuscitation

**5. Mechanical Ventilation**:
- **Lung-protective**: Tidal volume 6-8mL/kg ideal body weight, plateau pressure <30cmH2O
- **Avoid**: High airway pressures (risk abdominal compartment syndrome if open abdomen, barotrauma)
- **Oxygenation**: Maintain SpO2 >92-94%, PaO2 >60mmHg

**6. Monitor for Complications**:
- **Abdominal compartment syndrome** (see below)
- **Ongoing hemorrhage**: Hemodynamic instability, decreasing hemoglobin, increasing transfusion requirements → return to OR
- **Multi-organ failure**: ARDS, acute kidney injury

**Endpoints of Resuscitation**:
- **Lactate**: Normalize (<2 mmol/L)
- **Base deficit**: <4
- **Core temperature**: >36°C
- **Coagulation**: INR <1.5, fibrinogen >150mg/dL
- **Hemodynamics**: Stable (off vasopressors or low-dose)

### Phase III: Definitive Reconstruction (Return to OR)

**Timing**: 24-72 hours after initial operation (when physiology normalized)

**Goals**: Definitive repair, abdominal closure

**Steps**:

**1. Remove Packs**:
- Inspect abdomen for ongoing bleeding
- Re-pack if persistent bleeding, correct coagulopathy, return to OR again

**2. Definitive Organ Repair**:
- **Bowel**: Restore continuity (anastomosis), resect additional non-viable bowel
- **Liver/Spleen**: Remove packs, assess for ongoing bleeding
  - Liver: May leave packs if still oozing (remove at subsequent operation)
- **Pancreas/Duodenum**: Definitive reconstruction (drainage, pyloric exclusion, pancreaticoduodenectomy if needed)
- **Vascular**: Remove shunts, definitive repair (primary, patch, graft)

**3. Fascial Closure**:
- **Primary closure**: If no tension, acceptable intra-abdominal pressure
- **Delayed primary closure**: If edema, may need 2-3 operations before closure achievable
- **Planned ventral hernia**: If cannot close (severe edema, persistent bowel distension, high IAP)
  - Skin closure only, or mesh, repair hernia electively months later

**4. Stoma Creation** (if needed):
- Low colorectal anastomosis (high leak risk, already multiple insults)
- Severe contamination
- Hemodynamic instability (safer to divert than anastomose)

**Additional Operations**:
- May require multiple trips to OR (every 24-48 hours) before definitive closure
- **Serial "relook" laparotomies**: Assess viability, remove packs, progress toward closure

## Damage Control Resuscitation (DCR)

### Concept

**Pre-hospital and early hospital resuscitation** integrated with damage control surgery

**Principles**:
- **Permissive hypotension**: Avoid aggressive crystalloid before hemorrhage control
- **Balanced blood product resuscitation**: 1:1:1 ratio (RBC:FFP:Platelets)
- **Minimize crystalloid**: Worsens coagulopathy (dilution), hypothermia, edema
- **Tranexamic acid**: Within 3 hours of injury
- **Rapid hemorrhage control**: Tourniets (extremity), early surgery

### Massive Transfusion Protocol (MTP)

**Definition**: ≥10 units RBC in 24 hours, or ≥4 units in 1 hour

**Activation Criteria**:
- Shock (SBP <90, HR >120) with severe injury
- Positive FAST with hemodynamic instability
- Massive external hemorrhage

**Protocol**:
- **Coolers delivered** containing RBC, FFP, platelets in 1:1:1 ratio
- **Round 1**: 6 units RBC, 6 units FFP, 1 unit platelets (6-pack)
- **Subsequent rounds**: Same, until bleeding controlled or MTP deactivated
- **Reassess**: After each round (labs, clinical status)
- **Labs**: Hemoglobin, coagulation (PT/PTT/INR), fibrinogen, calcium, ABG (lactate, base deficit)
- **Calcium replacement**: Citrate in blood products chelates calcium (give calcium chloride or gluconate)

## Temporary Abdominal Closure (TAC)

### Importance

- Allows easy re-entry for planned reoperation
- Prevents abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS)
- Avoids fascial closure under tension

### Techniques

**Vacuum-Assisted Closure (VAC)** (most common):
- **Steps**:
  1. Place perforated plastic sheet (bowel bag) over bowel/omentum (protect viscera)
  2. Moist surgical towels over plastic
  3. Suction drains on top of towels
  4. Adhesive drape covers entire wound (seal)
  5. Suction applied (continuous, 75-150mmHg)
- **Advantages**: Removes fluid, prevents edema, facilitates closure
- **Complications**: Enteroatmospheric fistula (bowel erosion), granulation tissue

**Bogota Bag**:
- Sterile plastic (IV bag, urostomy bag) sutured to fascial edges
- Simple, cheap
- Less effective than VAC

**Mesh**:
- Absorbable or permanent mesh sutured to fascia
- Provides temporary fascial closure
- Risk: Mesh infection, need for later removal

**Skin-Only Closure**:
- Close skin with towel clips or sutures (not fascia)
- Simple but high fistula risk, planned ventral hernia

## Abdominal Compartment Syndrome (ACS)

### Definition

**Sustained intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) >20mmHg with new organ dysfunction**

### Pathophysiology

Increased IAP → compress IVC, renal veins → decreased venous return → decreased cardiac output → hypotension, oliguria

**Respiratory**: Elevated diaphragm → decreased lung compliance, hypoxemia, hypercarbia

**Renal**: Decreased renal perfusion → oliguria, anuria

**Abdominal**: Decreased mesenteric perfusion → bowel ischemia

### Risk Factors

- Damage control surgery with tight abdominal closure
- Massive resuscitation (>10L crystalloid, bowel edema)
- Abdominal packing
- Bowel edema (ischemia-reperfusion, resuscitation)

### Measurement

**Bladder Pressure** (surrogate for IAP):
- **Technique**: Foley catheter with pressure transducer, instill 25mL saline into bladder, measure pressure at end-expiration, zero at iliac crest
- **Normal**: <5-7mmHg
- **Intra-abdominal hypertension (IAH)**: 12-20mmHg (monitor closely)
- **Abdominal compartment syndrome**: >20mmHg with organ dysfunction

**Measure**: Every 4-6 hours in at-risk patients (damage control, massive resuscitation)

### Grading

- **Grade I**: 12-15mmHg
- **Grade II**: 16-20mmHg
- **Grade III**: 21-25mmHg
- **Grade IV**: >25mmHg

### Clinical Presentation

- **Hypotension**, **oliguria** (<0.5mL/kg/hr)
- **Elevated peak inspiratory pressures** (decreased lung compliance)
- **Distended, tense abdomen**
- **Worsening acidosis**, **hypoxemia**, **hypercarbia**

### Management

**Non-Operative** (if IAP 12-20mmHg, mild organ dysfunction):
- **Sedation, analgesia, paralysis**: Reduce abdominal wall muscle tone
- **Nasogastric decompression**: Reduce gastric distension
- **Rectal tube**: Decompress colon
- **Diuretics**: If fluid overload (remove excess fluid)
- **Avoid excessive fluids**: Minimize further resuscitation

**Operative** (if IAP >20mmHg with organ dysfunction):
- **Decompressive laparotomy**: Open abdomen, TAC
- **Immediate improvement**: Hemodynamics, urine output, ventilation often improve immediately upon decompression
- **Temporary closure**: VAC or Bogota bag
- **Subsequent closure**: When edema resolves, physiology normalized (days to weeks)

**Prevention**: TAC in damage control (do NOT force fascial closure)

## Outcomes

### Survival

**Damage Control vs. Definitive Surgery** (in appropriate patients):
- **Damage control**: 50-70% survival in severely injured (would have died with traditional approach)
- **Traditional**: <20% survival if lethal triad present

**Factors Affecting Survival**:
- **Severity of injury**: ISS >25 (Injury Severity Score)
- **Degree of physiologic derangement**: Worse lethal triad → worse outcomes
- **Time to hemorrhage control**: Faster control → better outcomes

### Complications

**Open Abdomen-Related**:
- **Enteroatmospheric fistula**: 5-25% (bowel erodes through abdominal wall, fistula to atmosphere)
  - Management: Nutritional support, may need surgical repair/diversion
- **Ventral hernia**: 50-80% (if cannot achieve primary closure)
  - Repair electively 6-12 months later (component separation, mesh)
- **Infection**: Intra-abdominal abscess, wound infection

**Multi-Organ Failure**:
- ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome)
- Acute kidney injury
- Hepatic dysfunction

### Fascial Closure Rates

- **Primary fascial closure**: 60-80% (if managed appropriately)
- **Timing**: Median 7-10 days
- **Delayed closure**: If persistent edema, may take weeks or never close (planned hernia)

## Special Considerations

### Damage Control Orthopedics

**Concept**: Temporary fracture stabilization (external fixation), definitive fixation later

**Indications**: Polytrauma with unstable fractures, hemodynamic instability

**Technique**: External fixator (quick), convert to internal fixation when stable

### Non-Trauma Damage Control

**Principles applied** to:
- **Ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm**: Control hemorrhage, resuscitate, definitive repair
- **Acute mesenteric ischemia**: Resect non-viable bowel, second-look laparotomy (reassess viability)
- **Severe pancreatitis**: Necrosectomy, pack, staged debridement
- **Perforated diverticulitis with shock**: Hartmann's procedure (damage control colectomy)

## Key Points

- Damage control surgery for severely injured patients with lethal triad (hypothermia <35°C, acidosis pH <7.2, coagulopathy INR >1.5); prolonged surgery in this setting causes intraoperative death
- Three phases: (I) abbreviated laparotomy to control hemorrhage/contamination (≤60-90 min), (II) ICU resuscitation to normalize physiology (24-48 hrs), (III) definitive reconstruction and closure
- Phase I goals: pack (perihepatic, perisplenic, pelvis), ligate vessels, staple bowel ends (no anastomosis), temporary abdominal closure; avoid complex repairs
- Phase II endpoints: lactate <2, base deficit <4, temperature >36°C, INR <1.5, off vasopressors before returning to OR
- Temporary abdominal closure (TAC) options: vacuum-assisted closure (VAC) most common; prevents abdominal compartment syndrome, allows easy re-entry
- Damage control resuscitation (DCR): permissive hypotension (SBP 80-90 before hemorrhage control), balanced 1:1:1 blood product ratio (RBC:FFP:platelets), minimize crystalloid, tranexamic acid within 3 hours
- Abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) defined as sustained IAP >20mmHg with organ dysfunction; presents with hypotension, oliguria, elevated ventilator pressures, tense abdomen
- ACS measured via bladder pressure (surrogate for IAP); normal <5-7mmHg, IAH 12-20mmHg, ACS >20mmHg with dysfunction; treat with decompressive laparotomy
- Complications of open abdomen: enteroatmospheric fistula (5-25%), planned ventral hernia (20-40% cannot achieve primary closure), infection
- Primary fascial closure achieved in 60-80% of damage control patients; median timing 7-10 days; may require multiple operations before closure
- Damage control improves survival in severely injured from <20% to 50-70% compared to traditional definitive surgery with lethal triad present
- "Better to be alive with open abdomen than dead with closed one" - accept temporary closure to save life
