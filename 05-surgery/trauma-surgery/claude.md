# Trauma Surgery

## Overview

Trauma surgery addresses life-threatening injuries from blunt and penetrating mechanisms. As the leading cause of death in patients under 45 years, trauma requires rapid assessment, resuscitation, and surgical intervention. The trauma surgeon must possess broad surgical expertise spanning all body cavities and organ systems. Modern trauma care emphasizes systematic evaluation (ATLS protocols), damage control principles for critically injured patients, and multidisciplinary team coordination. Time-sensitive decision-making distinguishes trauma surgery from elective procedures.

## Learning Objectives

- Master systematic trauma assessment using ATLS protocols
- Understand indications for emergent surgical intervention
- Learn damage control surgery principles for severely injured patients
- Apply non-operative management criteria for solid organ injuries
- Recognize life-threatening injuries requiring immediate treatment
- Perform emergency procedures (tube thoracostomy, ED thoracotomy)

## Key Points

- Trauma is the leading cause of death in patients <45 years; "golden hour" concept emphasizes rapid intervention
- ATLS primary survey follows ABCDE sequence: Airway, Breathing, Circulation, Disability, Exposure
- FAST exam assesses four areas for free fluid: perihepatic, perisplenic, pelvis, pericardium
- Damage control surgery for severely injured: abbreviated laparotomy, control hemorrhage/contamination, temporary closure, ICU resuscitation
- Non-operative management appropriate for hemodynamically stable patients with solid organ injuries (liver, spleen, kidney)
- ED thoracotomy indicated for penetrating chest trauma with signs of life; survival <10% overall, up to 35% for isolated cardiac injury
- Massive transfusion protocol uses balanced resuscitation (1:1:1 ratio RBC:FFP:platelets) to prevent trauma coagulopathy
