# Cardiac Surgery

## Overview
Cardiac surgery encompasses operative procedures on the heart and great vessels, including coronary artery bypass grafting, valve repair/replacement, congenital heart defect correction, aortic surgery, and cardiac transplantation. Modern cardiac surgery utilizes cardiopulmonary bypass, minimally invasive techniques, and advanced perioperative care. Success requires multidisciplinary collaboration between cardiac surgeons, cardiologists, anesthesiologists, perfusionists, and intensive care specialists.
