# Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting

## Overview

Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is the surgical creation of conduits to bypass obstructed coronary arteries, restoring blood flow to ischemic myocardium. CABG remains the gold standard for revascularization in patients with complex multi-vessel coronary artery disease, left main disease, and certain high-risk anatomic subsets. Understanding patient selection, conduit choice, surgical techniques, and perioperative management is essential for optimal outcomes.

## Coronary Artery Disease

### Pathophysiology

**Atherosclerosis**
- Lipid deposition in arterial intima
- Plaque formation, inflammation
- Stenosis reducing coronary blood flow
- Acute plaque rupture → thrombosis → myocardial infarction

**Critical Stenosis**
- ≥70% diameter reduction: Hemodynamically significant
- ≥50% left main stenosis: High-risk

### Clinical Presentation

**Stable Angina**
- Predictable chest pain with exertion
- Relieved by rest or nitroglycerin

**Acute Coronary Syndromes**
- **Unstable angina**: Rest angina, crescendo pattern
- **NSTEMI**: Non-ST elevation myocardial infarction
- **STEMI**: ST elevation myocardial infarction

**Silent Ischemia**
- Asymptomatic but evidence on stress testing

## Indications for CABG

### Anatomic Indications

**Strong Indications**
- **Left main disease**: ≥50% stenosis
- **Three-vessel disease**: Especially with reduced ejection fraction (<35%)
- **Two-vessel disease** with proximal LAD stenosis
- **Single-vessel disease**: LAD with large territory at risk

**Complex Coronary Anatomy**
- High SYNTAX score (>22): Favors CABG over PCI
- Chronic total occlusions
- Diffuse disease not amenable to PCI
- Bifurcation lesions

### Clinical Indications

**Failed Medical Management**
- Persistent angina despite optimal medical therapy

**Failed PCI**
- Restenosis after stenting
- Complications of PCI

**Cardiogenic Shock**
- Post-MI mechanical complications (VSD, papillary muscle rupture)

**Concomitant Procedures**
- Valve surgery
- Aortic surgery
- Ventricular aneurysm repair

## CABG vs. PCI Decision-Making

### Trials and Guidelines

**SYNTAX Trial**
- CABG superior for complex multi-vessel disease (SYNTAX score >22)
- PCI acceptable for low complexity disease (SYNTAX score <22)

**FREEDOM Trial**
- CABG superior to PCI in diabetic patients with multi-vessel disease
- Lower mortality and MI rates with CABG

**Current Guidelines** (ACC/AHA)
- **Class I recommendations for CABG**:
  - Left main disease (especially with SYNTAX >32)
  - Three-vessel disease with reduced EF
  - Two-vessel disease with proximal LAD
- **PCI may be considered**: Single-vessel disease, low SYNTAX score

**Heart Team Approach**
- Multidisciplinary decision-making: Cardio logist, cardiac surgeon, patient
- Consider anatomy, comorbidities, patient preferences

## Conduit Selection

### Internal Mammary Artery (IMA)

**Left Internal Mammary Artery (LIMA)**
- **Gold standard** conduit
- **Target**: Left anterior descending artery (LAD)
- **Patency**: 90-95% at 10 years, >80% at 20 years
- **Survival benefit**: LIMA-LAD improves long-term survival

**Right Internal Mammary Artery (RIMA)**
- **Targets**: RCA, circumflex, diagonal branches
- **Bilateral IMA (BIMA)**: Improved long-term outcomes vs. single IMA
- **Risk**: Increased sternal wound infection (especially diabetics, obese, COPD)

**Advantages**
- Excellent long-term patency
- Resistance to atherosclerosis
- In situ (pedicled) or free graft

**Disadvantages**
- Length limitations
- Sternal devascularization (bilateral IMA)
- Harvesting time

### Radial Artery

**Characteristics**
- Muscular conduit prone to spasm
- **Patency**: 85-90% at 10 years (superior to saphenous vein)
- **Targets**: High-grade stenosis (>70%), circumflex, RCA

**Advantages**
- Excellent long-term patency (second to IMA)
- Adequate length
- Easy harvesting

**Disadvantages**
- **Vasospasm**: Requires anti-spasmodic agents (diltiazem, nitrates)
- Contraindications: Abnormal Allen test, dialysis access, Raynaud's

**Harvesting Technique**
- Forearm incision, preserve ulnar artery
- Allen test preoperatively (assess collateral circulation)

### Saphenous Vein Graft (SVG)

**Characteristics**
- Most common conduit historically
- **Patency**: 60-70% at 10 years, 50% at 15 years
- **Targets**: RCA, circumflex, diagonal, sequential grafts

**Advantages**
- Adequate length for multiple grafts
- Easy harvesting
- No spasm

**Disadvantages**
- **Inferior patency**: Intimal hyperplasia, atherosclerosis
- **Vein graft disease**: 10-20% occlusion at 1 year, 50% at 10 years
- Leg wound complications

**Harvesting Techniques**
- **Open**: Long incision along leg
- **Endoscopic**: Smaller incisions, reduced wound complications

## Surgical Techniques

### On-Pump CABG (Conventional)

**Cardiopulmonary Bypass (CPB)**
- **Venous cannula**: Right atrium, drains deoxygenated blood to bypass machine
- **Oxygenator**: Gas exchange (removes CO2, adds O2)
- **Pump**: Circulates oxygenated blood back to patient
- **Arterial cannula**: Ascending aorta, delivers oxygenated blood

**Cardioplegia**
- **Purpose**: Cardiac arrest, myocardial protection
- **Types**:
  - **Cold blood cardioplegia**: 4-8°C, high potassium, induces diastolic arrest
  - **Warm blood cardioplegia**: 37°C, continuous or intermittent
  - **Crystalloid cardioplegia**: St. Thomas, Plegisol
- **Delivery**: Antegrade (aortic root), retrograde (coronary sinus), or both

**Operative Steps**
1. **Median sternotomy**: Divide sternum, expose heart
2. **Conduit harvesting**: LIMA, radial artery, saphenous vein
3. **Heparinization**: ACT >400 seconds
4. **CPB cannulation**: Aortic and right atrial cannulae
5. **Cross-clamp aorta**: Isolate heart from circulation
6. **Cardioplegia**: Arrest heart
7. **Distal anastomoses**: Sew grafts to coronary arteries beyond stenoses
8. **Remove cross-clamp**: Reperfuse heart
9. **Proximal anastomoses**: Attach grafts to aorta (side-biting clamp)
10. **Wean CPB**: Resume normal cardiac function
11. **Protamine**: Reverse heparin
12. **Hemostasis and closure**

**Advantages**
- **Motionless field**: Optimal visualization, precise anastomoses
- **Myocardial protection**: Cardioplegia
- **Complete revascularization**: Access to all vessels

**Disadvantages**
- **Systemic inflammatory response**: CPB triggers inflammation
- **Neurologic complications**: Stroke (1-3%), cognitive dysfunction
- **Coagulopathy**: Platelet dysfunction, dilutional coagulopathy
- **Renal dysfunction**: Decreased renal perfusion
- **Longer recovery**

### Off-Pump CABG (OPCAB, Beating Heart)

**Technique**
- No cardiopulmonary bypass
- Heart continues beating during anastomoses
- **Stabilizers**: Devices immobilize target vessel area
- **Positioning**: Heart tilted/lifted to access lateral and inferior vessels

**Advantages**
- **Avoid CPB complications**: No systemic inflammation, reduced stroke risk
- **Faster recovery**: Shorter ICU stay, less transfusion
- **Beneficial in high-risk patients**: Renal dysfunction, aortic atherosclerosis, elderly

**Disadvantages**
- **Technical difficulty**: Moving target, hemodynamic instability
- **Incomplete revascularization**: Difficulty accessing some vessels
- **Conversion to on-pump** (5-10%): If hemodynamically unstable

**Outcomes**
- **Equivalent mortality** to on-pump CABG
- **Reduced morbidity**: Less stroke, renal failure, transfusion (in high-risk patients)
- **Graft patency**: Slightly lower than on-pump (operator-dependent)

### Minimally Invasive CABG (MIDCAB)

**Technique**
- Small left thoracotomy (4-6 cm)
- LIMA to LAD grafting
- No CPB, beating heart
- Endoscopic or robotic-assisted

**Indications**
- Isolated LAD disease
- Redo CABG (avoid sternotomy)

**Advantages**
- **Cosmetic**: Smaller incision
- **Faster recovery**: Less pain, shorter hospital stay
- **Avoid sternotomy**: Reduced sternal complications

**Disadvantages**
- **Limited access**: Only LAD typically accessible
- **Technical difficulty**

### Hybrid Coronary Revascularization

**Concept**
- Combine MIDCAB (LIMA-LAD) with PCI to other vessels
- "Best of both worlds": Durable LIMA-LAD graft + less invasive PCI for other lesions

**Indications**
- Multi-vessel disease
- LAD + other vessel disease
- Avoid CPB in high-risk patients

**Technique**
- **Staged**: MIDCAB first, then PCI (or vice versa)
- **Simultaneous**: Hybrid OR, MIDCAB + PCI same setting

**Outcomes**
- Promising in select patients
- Long-term data limited

## Postoperative Management

### Immediate Postoperative (ICU)

**Hemodynamic Monitoring**
- Arterial line, central venous pressure, pulmonary artery catheter (if needed)
- Cardiac output monitoring
- Targets: MAP >65 mmHg, CVP 8-12 mmHg, CI >2.0 L/min/m²

**Ventilatory Support**
- Mechanical ventilation initially
- Extubation when: Hemodynamically stable, awake, adequate oxygenation/ventilation
- Typically 4-8 hours post-op

**Cardiac Output Optimization**
- **Preload**: Fluid resuscitation, blood products
- **Afterload**: Vasopressors (norepinephrine, vasopressin) or vasodilators (nitroprusside)
- **Contractility**: Inotropes (epinephrine, dobutamine, milrinone) if low cardiac output

**Bleeding Management**
- Monitor chest tube output
- **Transfusion thresholds**: Hgb <7 g/dL (restrictive strategy)

## Key Points

1. **CABG is preferred** over PCI for left main disease, complex multi-vessel disease (SYNTAX >22), and diabetic patients with multi-vessel disease.

2. **LIMA to LAD** is the gold standard conduit with >90% patency at 10 years; bilateral IMA use improves long-term outcomes but increases sternal infection risk.

3. **Radial artery** is the second-best conduit after IMA with 85-90% patency at 10 years; superior to saphenous vein graft.

4. **On-pump CABG** with cardiopulmonary bypass provides motionless field and complete revascularization; off-pump CABG avoids CPB complications in high-risk patients.

5. **Atrial fibrillation** complicates 25-40% of CABG cases, peaking POD #2-3; treated with beta-blockers and amiodarone.

6. **Stroke risk** (1-3%) is reduced by minimizing aortic manipulation, using epiaortic ultrasound to assess aortic atherosclerosis, and single cross-clamp technique.

7. **Sternal wound infection** risk is increased with diabetes, obesity, bilateral IMA, and COPD; deep sternal wound infection (mediastinitis) has 10-20% mortality.

8. **Saphenous vein graft disease** affects 10-20% of grafts at 1 year and 50% at 10 years due to intimal hyperplasia and atherosclerosis.

9. **Post-CABG medical management** includes aspirin, high-intensity statin, beta-blocker, and ACE inhibitor (if reduced EF), along with aggressive secondary prevention.

10. **CABG outcomes** are excellent with 1-2% operative mortality, 85-90% 5-year survival, and 80-90% freedom from angina at 5 years.
