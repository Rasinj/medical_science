# Surgical Principles

## Overview

Fundamental surgical principles form the foundation of safe and effective surgical practice. These principles encompass preoperative assessment, surgical safety, wound healing physiology, complication management, and postoperative care. Mastery of these concepts is essential for all surgeons regardless of specialty and directly impacts patient outcomes.

## Preoperative Assessment

### Patient Evaluation

  - LMWH or unfractionated heparin
  - Stop LMWH 24 hours before surgery, UFH 4-6 hours before
- **Resume**: Evening of surgery or POD 1 (if adequate hemostasis)

**DOACs** (Dabigatran, Rivaroxaban, Apixaban)
- **Stop 48-96 hours** before surgery (depends on renal function, bleeding risk)
- **Bridging**: Generally not needed
- **Resume**: 24-72 hours postoperatively

**Antiplatelet Agents**

- **P2Y12 Inhibitors** (Clopidogrel, Prasugrel, Ticagrelor):
  - **Stop 5-7 days** before elective surgery
  - **Exception**: Recent coronary stent
    - Bare metal stent: Continue dual antiplatelet for 4-6 weeks minimum
    - Drug-eluting stent: Continue for 12 months minimum
    - Delay elective surgery if possible

#### Nutritional Optimization

**Malnutrition Screening**
- **Indicators**: Weight loss >10% in 6 months, albumin <3.0 g/dL, prealbumin <15 mg/dL
- **Impact**: Increased complications, delayed healing, mortality

**Interventions**
- **Enteral Nutrition**: Preferred over parenteral (maintains gut integrity)
- **Immunonutrition**: Arginine, omega-3 fatty acids, nucleotides (may benefit cancer, GI surgery)
- **Preoperative Feeding**: 7-14 days if severely malnourished
- **Delay Elective Surgery**: If possible until nutritional status improved

#### Anemia Management

**Preoperative Anemia**
- **Prevalence**: 25-40% in surgical patients
- **Associated with**: Increased transfusion, complications, mortality

**Evaluation**
- Identify cause: Iron deficiency, chronic disease, renal insufficiency, blood loss
- Treat underlying cause

**Treatment**
- **Iron Supplementation**: Oral (2-4 weeks) or IV (faster)

- **Method**: Antiseptic soap (chlorhexidine, iodophor) or alcohol-based rub
- **Duration**: 2-5 minutes initial, 2-3 minutes subsequent (soap); per manufacturer (alcohol rub)

#### Skin Preparation

**Preoperative**
- **Bathing**: Chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG) bath night before and morning of surgery
- **Hair Removal**: Clippers only (not razors - increase SSI risk)

**Intraoperative**
- **Antiseptic**: Chlorhexidine-alcohol (preferred) or povidone-iodine
- **Technique**: Center to periphery in concentric circles
- **Drying**: Allow adequate drying time (bactericidal effect)

#### Sterile Field

**Draping**
- Sufficient to create sterile field
- Only sterile items within field
- Drape edges considered non-sterile

**Maintaining Sterility**
- Sterile team members face sterile field
- Pass instruments within sterile field
- Keep hands above waist level
- Avoid leaning over non-sterile areas

**Breach Protocol**
- Any suspected contamination: Re-gown/re-glove or replace instrument

### Patient Positioning and Pressure Injury Prevention

#### Positioning Principles

**Goals**
- Optimal surgical exposure
- Maintain physiologic alignment
- Prevent nerve injury
- Prevent pressure injuries

**Common Positions**
- **Supine**: Most common, arms <90° abduction
- **Trendelenburg**: Head down (pelvic surgery) - risk: facial edema, increased ICP
- **Reverse Trendelenburg**: Head up (abdominal surgery) - risk: hypotension
- **Lithotomy**: Legs in stirrups (GYN, rectal) - risk: compartment syndrome, neuropathy
- **Lateral Decubitus**: Side (thoracic, kidney) - risk: brachial plexus injury, pressure on dependent side
- **Prone**: Face down (spine, posterior) - risk: vision loss, abdominal compartment syndrome

#### Pressure Injury Prevention

**Risk Factors**
- Prolonged surgery (>3 hours)
- Hypotension, hypothermia
- Diabetes, vascular disease
- Malnutrition, advanced age

**Prevention**
- **Padding**: All bony prominences
- **Positioning Devices**: Gel pads, foam cushions
- **Avoid Shear**: Secure patient, minimize repositioning
- **Eye Protection**: Tape eyes closed, avoid pressure on globes
- **Assessment**: Immediate postoperative skin inspection

**Common Nerve Injuries**
- **Brachial Plexus**: Arm abduction >90°, lateral head rotation
- **Ulnar Nerve**: Elbow pressure
- **Radial Nerve**: Lateral arm compression
- **Common Peroneal Nerve**: Lateral fibular head pressure (lithotomy)

## Wound Healing

### Phases of Wound Healing

#### Hemostasis (Immediate, Minutes)

**Process**
- Vasoconstriction
- Platelet aggregation and plug formation
- Coagulation cascade activation
- Fibrin clot formation

**Clinical Implications**
- Adequate hemostasis essential before closure
- Anticoagulation/antiplatelet agents affect this phase
- Hematoma impairs subsequent healing

#### Inflammatory Phase (Day 0-4)

**Cellular Events**
- **Neutrophils** (24-48 hours): Phagocytosis of bacteria and debris
- **Macrophages** (48-96 hours): Debridement, growth factor secretion (PDGF, TGF-β, VEGF)

**Clinical Signs**
- Erythema, warmth, edema, pain (cardinal signs of inflammation)
- Essential for healing, but excessive inflammation impairs healing

**Factors Impairing Phase**
- Infection, foreign material
- Ischemia, hypoxia
- Immunosuppression, steroids
- Malnutrition

#### Proliferative Phase (Day 4-21)

**Processes**
1. **Granulation Tissue Formation**:
   - Fibroblasts deposit collagen (type III initially)
   - Angiogenesis (new blood vessel formation)
   - Re-epithelialization from wound edges

2. **Wound Contraction**:
   - Myofibroblasts contract wound
   - Reduces wound size

**Clinical Appearance**
- Pink, granular tissue (granulation)
- Wound edges migrate toward center
- Progressive reduction in wound size

#### Remodeling Phase (Day 21 - 1 Year+)

**Process**
- Collagen reorganization (type III → type I)
- Cross-linking increases tensile strength
- Scar maturation, remodeling

**Tensile Strength Timeline**
- **Week 1**: 3% of normal
- **Week 3**: 20% of normal (suture removal safe)
- **Week 6**: 50% of normal
- **Months 3-6**: 70-80% of normal (maximum, never reaches 100%)

**Scar Maturation**
- Initially raised, red (hypervascular)
- Gradually flattens, fades (decreased vascularity)
- Complete maturation: 12-18 months

### Types of Wound Healing

#### Primary Intention (First Intention)

**Definition**
- Wound edges approximated surgically (sutures, staples, adhesive)
- Minimal tissue loss
- Clean, linear closure

**Examples**
- Surgical incisions
- Clean lacerations

**Healing Time**
- Epithelialization: 24-48 hours
- Functional closure: 1-3 weeks

**Advantages**
- Fastest healing
- Minimal scarring
- Lowest infection risk

#### Secondary Intention (Second Intention)

**Definition**
- Wound left open to heal by granulation, contraction, epithelialization
- Large tissue defect or contaminated wound

**Examples**
- Pressure ulcers
- Contaminated wounds
- Abscesses after drainage

**Healing Time**
- Weeks to months (depends on wound size)

**Advantages**
- Allows drainage of infected/contaminated wounds
- Avoids closure under tension

**Disadvantages**
- Prolonged healing
- Increased scarring
- Wound care intensive

#### Tertiary Intention (Delayed Primary Closure)

**Definition**
- Wound initially left open (contaminated or high risk)
- Delayed closure after 3-7 days when clean

**Examples**
- Contaminated traumatic wounds
- Abscess cavities after resolution of infection

**Advantages**
- Reduces infection risk compared to immediate closure
- Better cosmesis than secondary intention

**Timing**
- Typically 3-7 days after injury
- Before granulation tissue formation

### Factors Affecting Wound Healing

#### Local Factors

**Infection**
- Most common cause of impaired healing
- Bacterial load >10^5 organisms/gram tissue
- Prevention: Debridement, irrigation, antibiotics if indicated

**Blood Supply**
- **Adequate Perfusion**: Essential for oxygen and nutrient delivery
- **Impaired**: Arterial insufficiency, venous stasis, smoking, radiation
- **Improvement**: Smoking cessation, revascularization, offloading

**Tension**
- **Excessive Tension**: Ischemia, dehiscence
- **Reduction**: Undermining, advancement flaps, delayed closure

**Foreign Bodies**
- Sutures, mesh, debris, necrotic tissue
- Nidus for infection
- Removal if causing problems

**Hematoma/Seroma**
- Separates wound edges
- Infection risk
- Prevention: Hemostasis, drains, compression

**Radiation**
- **Acute**: Dermatitis, delayed healing
- **Chronic**: Fibrosis, poor vascularity, non-healing wounds
- **Hyperbaric Oxygen**: May benefit radiation-injured tissue

#### Systemic Factors

**Age**
- **Elderly**: Slower healing, thinner skin
- **Mechanisms**: Decreased cellular proliferation, reduced growth factors
- **Management**: Attention to nutrition, comorbidities

**Nutrition**
- **Protein**: Essential for collagen synthesis (1.5-2 g/kg/day for healing)
- **Vitamin C**: Cofactor for collagen cross-linking
- **Vitamin A**: Promotes epithelialization, counteracts steroid effects
- **Zinc**: Cofactor for enzymes
- **Malnutrition**: Albumin <3.0 g/dL associated with poor healing

**Obesity**
- **Impaired Healing**: Poor vascularity of adipose tissue
- **Increased Infection**: Decreased oxygen tension
- **Mechanical**: Increased wound tension

**Diabetes**
- **Mechanisms**: Microvascular disease, neuropathy, immune dysfunction
- **Glycemic Control**: HbA1c <7-8% improves healing
- **Infection Risk**: Higher SSI rates

**Hypoxia**
- **Tissue Oxygen**: <30-40 mmHg impairs healing
- **Causes**: Anemia, hypovolemia, hypoxemia, vascular disease
- **Treatment**: Supplemental oxygen, transfusion, fluid resuscitation

**Immunosuppression**
- **Steroids**: Impair inflammation, collagen synthesis (vitamin A may counteract)
- **Chemotherapy**: Affects proliferation
- **Biologics**: TNF-α inhibitors, other immunomodulators
- **Management**: Minimize doses, consider timing of surgery

**Smoking**
- **Mechanisms**: Vasoconstriction (nicotine), tissue hypoxia (carbon monoxide), impaired immunity
- **Increased Complications**: SSI, dehiscence, flap necrosis
- **Cessation**: Benefits seen with 4-8 weeks preoperatively

### Wound Closure Materials

#### Sutures

**Absorbable**
- **Synthetic**: Polyglactin (Vicryl), polyglycolic acid (Dexon), poliglecaprone (Monocryl), polydioxanone (PDS)
  - **Rapid Absorption** (7-14 days): Vicryl Rapide, chromic gut
  - **Intermediate** (3-4 weeks): Vicryl, Monocryl
  - **Extended** (6-8 weeks): PDS
- **Natural**: Gut (plain, chromic) - rarely used (inflammatory response)
- **Uses**: Subcutaneous, mucosal, internal organs

**Non-Absorbable**
- **Synthetic**: Nylon, polypropylene (Prolene), polyester (Ethibond), PTFE (Gore-Tex)
- **Natural**: Silk (technically absorbable >2 years)
- **Uses**: Skin, fascia (permanent strength), vascular anastomoses

**Monofilament vs. Multifilament**
- **Monofilament**: Lower infection risk, less tissue drag, harder to handle
- **Multifilament (Braided)**: Easier to handle, better knot security, higher infection risk

**Size**
- **Larger Number = Smaller Suture**: 0 > 2-0 > 3-0 > 4-0 > 5-0, etc.
- **Heavy Sutures** (0, 1, 2): Fascia, retention sutures
- **Medium** (2-0, 3-0, 4-0): Subcutaneous, most skin
- **Fine** (5-0, 6-0, 7-0): Face, vessels, nerves

#### Staples

**Skin Staples**
- **Advantages**: Fast application, low tissue reactivity
- **Disadvantages**: More painful removal, poorer cosmesis
- **Uses**: Scalp, trunk, extremities (not face)
- **Removal**: 7-14 days

**Surgical Staplers**
- **Linear**: Bowel division, vessel ligation
- **Circular**: Anastomoses (esophagus, bowel)
- **Skin**: Rapid skin closure

#### Adhesive

**Tissue Adhesive** (2-octyl cyanoacrylate, Dermabond)
- **Advantages**: No removal needed, waterproof, quick
- **Disadvantages**: Cannot be used on infected wounds, tension areas
- **Uses**: Clean lacerations, low-tension incisions, pediatrics
- **Sloughs Off**: 5-10 days

**Adhesive Strips** (Steri-Strips)
- Reinforcement after suture removal or for low-tension wounds
- Falls off as skin heals

## Complications

- **Evidence-Based**: Protocols based on best evidence
- **Multidisciplinary**: Surgeons, anesthesiologists, nurses, pharmacists

**Key Elements** (Covered in Detail in Specific Surgery Sections)
- **Preoperative**: Counseling, no prolonged fasting, carbohydrate loading, no bowel prep (most cases)
- **Intraoperative**: Minimally invasive when possible, short-acting anesthetics, goal-directed fluid therapy, normothermia
- **Postoperative**: Early feeding, early mobilization, multimodal analgesia (minimize opioids), VTE prophylaxis, remove tubes/catheters early

**Outcomes**
- Reduced length of stay
- Fewer complications
- Faster return of function
- High patient satisfaction

### Pain Management

#### Multimodal Analgesia

**Rationale**: Multiple mechanisms, lower doses, fewer side effects

**Components**
- **Acetaminophen**: 1000 mg q6h scheduled
- **NSAIDs**: Ibuprofen, ketorolac (if no contraindications - renal, bleeding)
- **Gabapentinoids**: Gabapentin, pregabalin (neuropathic pain component)
- **Local/Regional Anesthesia**: Infiltration, nerve blocks, epidural
- **Opioids**: For breakthrough pain only, minimize

**Opioid Stewardship**
- **Risks**: Respiratory depression, ileus, nausea, dependence
- **Minimize**: Use lowest effective dose, transition to non-opioid quickly
- **Patient Education**: Expectations for pain, alternatives, disposal of unused medication

#### Regional Anesthesia Techniques

**Neuraxial**
- **Epidural**: Thoracic (thoracotomy, abdominal), lumbar (lower extremity, perineal)
- **Spinal**: Single-shot, lower body surgery
- **Benefits**: Superior pain control, reduced opioid use, earlier return of bowel function
- **Risks**: Hypotension, urinary retention, epidural hematoma (rare)

**Peripheral Nerve Blocks**
- **Upper Extremity**: Interscalene, supraclavicular, axillary
- **Lower Extremity**: Femoral, sciatic, popliteal, adductor canal
- **Truncal**: TAP block (transversus abdominis plane), rectus sheath
- **Duration**: Single-shot (12-24 hours) or continuous catheter

**Local Infiltration**
- Incision site infiltration with long-acting local anesthetic (bupivacaine, ropivacaine)
- Simple, safe, effective

### Nutrition

#### Early Enteral Nutrition

**Benefits**
- Maintains gut integrity and barrier function
- Reduces infectious complications
- Improves wound healing
- Shorter hospital stay

**ERAS Approach**
- **Clear Liquids**: POD 0 for most surgeries
- **Regular Diet**: POD 1, as tolerated
- **No Need to "Wait for Bowel Sounds"**: Outdated practice

**Contraindications**
- High-output fistula proximal to feeding
- Intestinal obstruction
- Severe ileus with vomiting
- Hemodynamic instability

#### Nutritional Support (If Unable to Feed Orally)

**Enteral Nutrition** (Preferred)
- **Routes**: Nasogastric, nasoduodenal, nasojejunal, gastrostomy, jejunostomy
- **Indications**: Functional GI tract but unable to take adequate PO
- **Benefits**: Cheaper, maintains gut function, fewer infections than TPN

**Parenteral Nutrition (TPN)**
- **Indications**: Non-functional GI tract, short bowel syndrome, high-output fistula, prolonged ileus
- **Complications**: Catheter-related infections, liver dysfunction, metabolic (refeeding syndrome)
- **Goal**: Transition to enteral as soon as possible

**Timing**
- **Well-Nourished**: Can tolerate 7-10 days without nutrition
- **Malnourished**: Start within 3-5 days if unable to feed enterally

### Mobility and Rehabilitation

**Early Mobilization**
- **Goals**: Out of bed POD 0 or 1, ambulate multiple times daily
- **Benefits**: Reduces VTE, pneumonia, ileus, deconditioning
- **Barriers**: Pain, drains, catheters, patient/staff culture

**Physical Therapy**
- **Indications**: Major surgery, elderly, prolonged hospitalization, deconditioning
- **Goals**: Return to baseline function, independence

**Prehabilitation**
- **Concept**: Optimize fitness before surgery
- **Components**: Exercise, nutrition, smoking cessation, stress reduction
- **Evidence**: Emerging, shows promise in reducing complications

## Key Points

### Preoperative Assessment
- **Risk stratification** using ASA class, RCRI (cardiac), and VTE scores guides perioperative management
- **Medical optimization** includes cardiac (continue beta-blockers, statins), pulmonary (bronchodilators, smoking cessation), diabetes (HbA1c <8%), and anticoagulation management
- **Nutritional screening** identifies high-risk patients (weight loss >10%, albumin <3.0) who benefit from preoperative nutrition
- **Informed consent** requires disclosure of risks/benefits, patient capacity, and voluntariness

### Surgical Safety
- **WHO Surgical Safety Checklist** reduces perioperative complications and mortality
- **Antibiotic prophylaxis** within 60 minutes of incision (single dose sufficient for most procedures)
- **Sterile technique** and infection prevention measures (CHG bathing, clippers not razors, skin prep) reduce SSI
- **Patient positioning** must balance surgical access with prevention of nerve injury and pressure ulcers

### Wound Healing
- **Three phases**: Hemostasis/inflammation (0-4 days), proliferation (4-21 days), remodeling (21 days-1 year+)
- **Tensile strength** reaches only 70-80% of normal at maximum (3-6 months)
- **Factors impairing healing**: Infection (most common), ischemia, malnutrition, diabetes, smoking, steroids
- **Primary intention** (closed) heals fastest with best cosmesis; **secondary intention** (open) for contaminated wounds

### Complications
- **SSI prevention**: Antibiotic prophylaxis, glycemic control, normothermia, sterile technique
- **Wound dehiscence**: "Salmon-colored" drainage POD 5-7 is warning sign; requires urgent operative repair if fascial
- **Anastomotic leak**: High index of suspicion, CT diagnosis, management ranges from drainage to reoperation
- **VTE prophylaxis**: Essential with mechanical and/or pharmacologic methods based on risk

### Postoperative Care
- **ERAS protocols** reduce LOS and complications through multimodal interventions
- **Multimodal analgesia** (acetaminophen, NSAIDs, regional blocks, minimize opioids) provides superior pain control
- **Early enteral nutrition** (POD 0-1) is safe and beneficial for most patients
- **Early mobilization** reduces VTE, pneumonia, ileus, and deconditioning
