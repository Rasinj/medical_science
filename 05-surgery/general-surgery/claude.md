# General Surgery

## Overview
General surgery encompasses a wide range of operative procedures involving the abdomen, breast, endocrine system, gastrointestinal tract, and soft tissues. General surgeons are trained in the diagnosis and management of a broad spectrum of surgical conditions, with expertise in both elective and emergency surgical procedures.
