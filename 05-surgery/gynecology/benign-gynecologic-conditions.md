# Benign Gynecologic Conditions

## Overview

Benign gynecologic conditions represent the majority of gynecologic surgical cases, including uterine fibroids, endometriosis, ovarian cysts, abnormal uterine bleeding, and chronic pelvic pain. While non-malignant, these conditions significantly impact quality of life, fertility, and overall health. Modern surgical management emphasizes conservative, fertility-preserving approaches when appropriate, with increasing use of minimally invasive techniques. Treatment decisions balance symptom severity, reproductive goals, patient age, and comorbidities.

## Uterine Leiomyomas (Fibroids)

### Overview
- Most common benign tumor in women (70-80% lifetime prevalence)
- Estrogen and progesterone-dependent smooth muscle tumors
- Peak incidence: 40-50 years
- African American women: 2-3x higher prevalence, earlier onset, more severe
- Often asymptomatic (discovered incidentally)

### Pathophysiology
- Monoclonal smooth muscle cell proliferation
- Genetic mutations (MED12, HMGA2)
- Hormonal stimulation (estrogen, progesterone)
- Growth factors (TGF-β, EGF, VEGF)

### Classification (Location)
**Submucosal**:
- Protrude into uterine cavity
- Most symptomatic (abnormal bleeding)
- Affect fertility
- Types 0-2 based on myometrial involvement (FIGO classification)

**Intramural**:
- Within myometrium (most common)
- Cause bulk symptoms
- Can distort cavity if large

**Subserosal**:
- Project from uterine serosa
- Least symptomatic
- Can become pedunculated

**Pedunculated**:
- Attached by stalk (can be submucosal or subserosal)
- Risk of torsion

**Cervical**:
- Arise from cervix (rare, 2-3%)
- Complicate hysterectomy

### Clinical Presentation

**Symptoms** (30-50% symptomatic):
- **Abnormal uterine bleeding** (30%):
  - Heavy menstrual bleeding (menorrhagia)
  - Prolonged menses
  - Intermenstrual bleeding (submucosal)
- **Bulk symptoms**:
  - Pelvic pressure, heaviness
  - Urinary frequency, urgency (bladder compression)
  - Constipation (rectal compression)
  - Abdominal distension
- **Pain**:
  - Dysmenorrhea
  - Acute pain (degeneration, torsion of pedunculated fibroid)
- **Reproductive**:
  - Infertility (submucosal fibroids)
  - Pregnancy complications (preterm labor, malpresentation, placental abruption)

**Examination**:
- Enlarged, irregular uterus
- Palpable masses
- Firm, mobile

### Diagnosis

**Imaging**:
- **Transvaginal ultrasound**: First-line
  - Identify fibroids, location, number, size
  - Assess cavity distortion
- **Saline infusion sonography (SIS)**: Define submucosal fibroids
- **MRI**:
  - Precise mapping for surgical planning
  - Distinguish adenomyosis
  - Plan uterine artery embolization
- **Hysteroscopy**: Direct visualization of submucosal fibroids

**Laboratory**:
- CBC (assess anemia from bleeding)
- Iron studies
- Pregnancy test (exclude pregnancy)
- TSH (exclude thyroid disorder)

### Medical Management

**Indications**:
- Mild symptoms
- Approaching menopause
- Poor surgical candidate
- Desire to avoid surgery

**Hormonal Therapies**:

**GnRH Agonists** (Leuprolide):
- Induce hypoestrogenic state
- Reduce fibroid size 35-65%
- Reduce bleeding
- **Duration**: Limit to 3-6 months (bone loss)
- **Use**: Preoperative (reduce size, correct anemia) or bridge to menopause
- **Side effects**: Hot flashes, vaginal dryness, bone loss

**GnRH Antagonists** (Elagolix):
- Similar to agonists but faster onset
- Combination with add-back therapy (estrogen/progestin) reduces side effects

**Progestins**:
- **Levonorgestrel IUD** (Mirena): Reduces menorrhagia
- **Oral progestins**: Variable efficacy
- Does not reduce fibroid size

**Combined Oral Contraceptives**:
- Regulate bleeding
- No effect on fibroid size

**Tranexamic Acid**:
- Antifibrinolytic, reduces menstrual blood loss 40-50%
- No effect on fibroid size
- Well-tolerated

**NSAIDs**:
- Reduce menstrual blood loss, dysmenorrhea
- No effect on fibroid size

### Surgical Management

#### Myomectomy

**Indications**:
- Symptomatic fibroids
- Desire for uterine preservation/future fertility
- Submucosal fibroids affecting fertility
- Single or few fibroids amenable to resection

**Contraindications**:
- Too numerous to remove
- Extensive myometrial involvement
- Rapid fibroid growth (rule out sarcoma)
- No desire for fertility and prefer hysterectomy

**Approaches**:

- **Technique**:
  1. Cervical dilation
  2. Hysteroscope insertion
  3. Distending media (glycine, saline)
  4. Resectoscope or morcellator
  5. Resect fibroid in strips or morcellate
  6. Ensure complete removal
- **Advantages**: Outpatient, quick recovery, preserve fertility
- **Complications**: Uterine perforation (1-2%), fluid overload, bleeding, adhesions

**Laparoscopic Myomectomy**:
- **Indications**: Subserosal, intramural fibroids (limited number and size)
- **Technique**:
  1. Port placement (3-4 ports)
  2. Vasopressin injection (reduce bleeding)
  3. Uterine incision over fibroid
  4. Enucleate fibroid (identify plane)
  5. Multilayer closure (restore uterine integrity)
  6. Morcellation of fibroid (contained bag to prevent seeding)
- **Advantages**: Minimally invasive, faster recovery than open
- **Disadvantages**: Technically challenging, limited by number/size, requires suturing skills

**Robotic Myomectomy**:
- Similar to laparoscopic with enhanced suturing capability
- 3D visualization
- Articulating instruments
- Preferred for intramural fibroids requiring extensive repair

**Abdominal (Open) Myomectomy**:
- **Indications**: Large fibroids, numerous fibroids, difficult location, failed laparoscopic
- **Technique**:
  1. Pfannenstiel or vertical midline incision
  2. Vasopressin injection
  3. Uterine incision (minimize entry points)
  4. Enucleate fibroids
  5. Multilayer closure (restore anatomy, minimize adhesions)
  6. Consider adhesion barriers
- **Advantages**: Allows removal of any size/number, optimal uterine repair
- **Disadvantages**: Longer recovery, more pain, adhesions

**Postoperative Care**:
- Hospital stay: Same-day (hysteroscopic), 23-hour (laparoscopic/robotic), 2-3 days (open)
- Pain management
- Early ambulation
- Avoid intercourse 6 weeks
- Future pregnancy considerations (cesarean may be recommended if myometrium extensively incised)

**Outcomes**:
- Symptom improvement: 80-90%
- Fertility improvement: Variable (improved with submucosal removal)
- Pregnancy rates: 40-65% if fibroid-related infertility
- **Recurrence**: 15-30% at 5 years (new fibroids develop)

**Complications**:
- Bleeding (transfusion 1-5%)
- Uterine rupture in future pregnancy (rare, <1%)

- **Laparoscopic/Robotic**: Minimally invasive alternative
- **Abdominal**: Large uterus, adhesions, difficult anatomy

**Outcomes**:
- Definitive treatment (100% cure)
- High satisfaction rates (>90%)
- See hysterectomy section for details

#### Uterine Artery Embolization (UAE)

**Indications**:
- Symptomatic fibroids
- Desire to avoid surgery
- Not seeking future fertility (relative contraindication)

**Technique**:

## Endometriosis

### Overview
- Presence of endometrial-like tissue outside uterus
- Affects 10% of reproductive-age women
- 30-50% of women with infertility
- Chronic, estrogen-dependent condition
- Often recurs after treatment

### Pathophysiology
**Theories**:
- **Retrograde menstruation**: Sampson's theory (most accepted)
- **Coelomic metaplasia**: Peritoneal cells transform
- **Vascular/lymphatic dissemination**: Distant sites
- **Stem cell theory**: Endometrial stem cells
- **Immune dysfunction**: Impaired clearance

### Classification

**Locations**:
- **Pelvic**: Ovaries (most common), uterosacral ligaments, bladder, bowel, pelvic peritoneum
- **Extrapelvic**: Diaphragm, lungs, surgical scars

**ASRM Staging**:
- **Stage I**: Minimal (1-5 points)
- **Stage II**: Mild (6-15 points)
- **Stage III**: Moderate (16-40 points)
- **Stage IV**: Severe (>40 points)
- Based on: Location, depth, size of implants, adhesions, endometriomas

**Lesion Appearance**:
- Classic "powder burn" (black, blue-black)
- Red (early, active)
- White (fibrotic, scarred)
- Clear vesicles

### Clinical Presentation

**Symptoms**:
- **Dysmenorrhea** (50-90%): Severe, progressive
- **Chronic pelvic pain** (30-50%): Non-cyclic
- **Dyspareunia** (40-50%): Deep

- **Abnormal bleeding**: Menorrhagia, spotting (less common)

**Examination**:
- Uterosacral nodularity, tenderness
- Fixed, retroverted uterus
- Adnexal masses (endometriomas)
- Cul-de-sac nodularity

### Diagnosis

**Imaging**:
- **Transvaginal ultrasound**:
  - Endometriomas ("chocolate cysts"): Ground-glass appearance
  - Limited for peritoneal disease
- **MRI**: Superior for deep infiltrating endometriosis, bladder/bowel involvement

**Laboratory**:
- **CA-125**: May be elevated (non-specific)
- No definitive blood test

**Definitive Diagnosis**: Laparoscopy with biopsy (gold standard)
- Visual inspection
- Biopsy of lesions
- Histologic confirmation

### Medical Management

**Indications**:
- Pain management
- Delay surgery
- Postoperative recurrence prevention

**NSAIDs**:
- First-line for dysmenorrhea
- Reduces prostaglandin production

**Hormonal Suppression**:

**Combined Oral Contraceptives**:
- Continuous or cyclic
- Suppress ovulation, decidualize endometrium
- Reduces pain in 60-80%

**Progestins**:
- **Depot medroxyprogesterone acetate** (Depo-Provera): 150mg IM q3 months
- **Levonorgestrel IUD** (Mirena)
- **Norethindrone acetate**: Daily oral
- **Dienogest**: Approved in some countries
- Suppress endometrium, reduce inflammation
- Effective for pain relief

**GnRH Agonists**:
- **Leuprolide** (Lupron Depot): Monthly or 3-month depot
- Induce hypoestrogenic state
- Highly effective for pain (80-90%)
- **Limit**: 6-12 months (bone loss)
- **Add-back therapy**: Low-dose estrogen/progestin to reduce side effects

**GnRH Antagonists**:
- **Elagolix** (Orilissa): Oral, dose-dependent estrogen suppression

- Rarely used now

### Surgical Management

#### Diagnostic and Therapeutic Laparoscopy

**Indications**:
- Severe pain refractory to medical management
- Infertility with suspected endometriosis
- Endometrioma >4cm
- Suspected deep infiltrating endometriosis
- Diagnostic confirmation

**Surgical Goals**:
- Excise or ablate visible endometriosis
- Lyse adhesions (restore normal anatomy)
- Remove endometriomas
- Resect deep infiltrating disease if feasible

**Technique**:
1. **Systematic pelvic survey**: Identify all disease
2. **Peritoneal disease**:
   - **Excision**: Preferred (removes disease completely, allows histology)
   - **Ablation**: Laser, electrocautery (destroys lesions)
3. **Endometrioma cystectomy**:
   - Drain cyst
   - Identify plane between cyst wall and ovary
   - Strip cyst wall (complete removal reduces recurrence)
   - Hemostasis (minimize ovarian damage)
4. **Deep infiltrating endometriosis**:
   - Uterosacral nodules: Excision
   - Bowel: Shave, disc excision, or segmental resection
   - Bladder: Partial cystectomy if involved
   - Ureter: Ureterolysis, stent if needed
5. **Adhesiolysis**: Restore normal anatomy
6. **Presacral neurectomy** (optional): Severe midline pain

**Postoperative Care**:
- Same-day or 23-hour discharge (uncomplicated)
- Pain management
- Early ambulation
- **Medical suppression**: Consider postoperative hormonal therapy to reduce recurrence

**Outcomes**:
- **Pain relief**: 60-80% at 6-12 months
- **Recurrence**: 20-40% within 5 years
- **Fertility**: Improved pregnancy rates with excision of minimal/mild disease
- **Endometriomas**: Lower recurrence with excision vs. drainage/ablation

**Complications**:
- **Ovarian damage**: Reduced ovarian reserve (especially with bilateral endometriomas)
- **Bowel injury**: Higher risk with deep disease
- **Ureteral injury**: Especially with uterosacral disease
- **Bladder injury**
- **Bleeding**
- **Adhesion formation**

#### Hysterectomy with Bilateral Salpingo-Oophorectomy

**Indications**:
- Severe, refractory symptoms
- No desire for future fertility
- Failed conservative surgery and medical management
- Adenomyosis with endometriosis

**Technique**:
- Total hysterectomy
- BSO (remove ovaries to eliminate estrogen source)
- Excise all visible endometriosis

**Outcomes**:
- Definitive treatment for most
- Pain relief in 80-90%
- Recurrence rare if BSO performed
- Requires hormone replacement (if premenopausal)

### Fertility and Endometriosis

**Mechanisms of Infertility**:
- Adhesions (distort anatomy)
- Ovarian damage (endometriomas)
- Inflammatory environment
- Impaired implantation

**Treatment**:
- **Mild endometriosis**: Laparoscopic excision improves fertility
- **Moderate/severe**: Surgery to restore anatomy, then ART
- **Endometriomas**: Cystectomy vs. aspiration (balance fertility with ovarian reserve)
- **Medical therapy**: Does not improve fertility (suppress ovulation)
- **Assisted reproductive technology**: IVF effective, bypasses tubal/peritoneal factors

## Ovarian Cysts and Benign Adnexal Masses

### Overview
- Common, especially reproductive age
- Most are functional (follicular, corpus luteum)
- Majority resolve spontaneously
- Distinguish benign from malignant critical

### Functional Cysts

**Follicular Cysts**:
- Unruptured follicle
- Usually <5cm
- Asymptomatic or mild discomfort
- Resolve spontaneously in 1-3 cycles

**Corpus Luteum Cysts**:
- Hemorrhagic corpus luteum
- Can rupture (hemoperitoneum)
- Usually <3cm, resolve spontaneously

**Theca Lutein Cysts**:
- Associated with high β-hCG (molar pregnancy, multifetal gestation)
- Bilateral, multilocular
- Resolve after delivery/evacuation

### Benign Neoplastic Cysts

**Mature Cystic Teratoma (Dermoid)**:
- Most common benign ovarian tumor in reproductive age
- Contains tissue from all three germ layers (hair, teeth, fat)
- Diagnosis: Echogenic focus on ultrasound, fat on CT/MRI
- Complications: Torsion (10%), rupture (1-4%, chemical peritonitis)
- Management: Cystectomy (preserve ovary)

**Cystadenoma**:
- **Serous**: Thin-walled, unilocular
- **Mucinous**: Multilocular, can become very large
- Management: Surgical excision

**Endometrioma** (See Endometriosis section)

### Evaluation

**Imaging**:
- **Ultrasound**: First-line
  - Simple cyst: Anechoic, thin wall, no septations/solid components (benign)
  - Complex cyst: Septations, solid components, vascularity (concerning)
- **MRI**: Characterize indeterminate masses
- **CT**: Rarely needed for adnexal masses

**Risk Stratification**:
- **Low risk (benign features)**:
  - Simple cyst <5cm
  - Mature teratoma
  - Premenopausal patient
  - Normal CA-125
- **High risk (malignancy concern)**:
  - Postmenopausal
  - Solid components, thick septations
  - Ascites
  - Elevated CA-125
  - Bilateral masses
  - Irregular borders

**CA-125**:
- Elevated in epithelial ovarian cancer
- Also elevated in: Endometriosis, fibroids, PID, menstruation
- **Premenopausal**: Poor specificity
- **Postmenopausal**: More specific for malignancy

**Risk of Malignancy Index (RMI)**:
- Combines: Ultrasound score, menopausal status, CA-125
- Predicts malignancy risk

### Management

**Observation**:
- **Indications**: Simple cysts <5cm (premenopausal), likely functional
- **Follow-up**: Repeat ultrasound in 6-12 weeks
- Most resolve spontaneously

**Oral Contraceptives**:
- No evidence accelerates resolution
- May prevent future functional cysts

**Aspiration**:
- High recurrence rate
- Not recommended

**Surgical Management**:

**Indications**:
- Persistent cyst (>3 cycles)
- Cyst >5cm (lower threshold if symptoms or postmenopausal)
- Concern for malignancy
- Acute complications (torsion, rupture)
- Symptomatic

**Ovarian Cystectomy** (Preferred for benign masses):
- **Approach**: Laparoscopy (preferred), laparotomy if large/malignancy concern
- **Technique**:
  1. Inspect ovary
  2. Incise ovarian cortex
  3. Enucleate cyst (identify plane)
  4. Remove cyst intact if possible (prevent spillage if malignant)
  5. Hemostasis
  6. Minimize ovarian damage (preserve function)
- **Frozen section**: If malignancy concern (proceed to staging if cancer)
- Preserve ovary when possible (fertility, hormone production)

**Oophorectomy**:
- **Indications**: Postmenopausal, cannot preserve ovary, large dermoid, malignancy
- Remove entire ovary

**Salpingo-Oophorectomy**:
- Remove tube and ovary together
- Reduces future ovarian cancer risk (fallopian tube origin theory)

**Complications**:
- **Ovarian damage**: Reduced reserve
- **Cyst rupture**: Spillage (chemical peritonitis if dermoid, staging issue if malignancy)
- **Adhesions**
- **Bleeding**
- **Infection**

## Abnormal Uterine Bleeding

### Overview
- Common indication for gynecologic surgery
- **PALM-COEIN Classification** (FIGO):
  - **Structural** (PALM): Polyp, Adenomyosis, Leiomyoma, Malignancy/hyperplasia
  - **Non-structural** (COEIN): Coagulopathy, Ovulatory dysfunction, Endometrial, Iatrogenic, Not classified

### Surgical Management

#### Hysteroscopy with Polypectomy/Myomectomy

**Indications**:
- Endometrial polyps
- Submucosal fibroids
- Abnormal bleeding with cavity lesion

**Technique**: (See fibroid section for details)
- Direct visualization
- Resection or removal with hysteroscope

#### Endometrial Ablation

**Indications**:

- Normal endometrial biopsy (rule out hyperplasia/cancer)
- Uterus <12 weeks size

**Contraindications**:
- Pregnancy or desire for future pregnancy
- Endometrial hyperplasia or cancer
- Active infection
- Previous classical cesarean or myomectomy (risk of perforation)

**Techniques**:
- **First generation** (Hysteroscopic):
  - Rollerball/loop ablation
  - Laser ablation
  - Requires hysteroscopic skills
- **Second generation** (Non-hysteroscopic):
  - Thermal balloon (ThermaChoice)
  - Cryoablation (Her Option)
  - Radiofrequency (NovaSure)
  - Microwave (MEA)
  - Hot fluid (Hydro ThermAblator)
  - Easier to perform, shorter procedure time

**Postoperative Care**:
- Same-day discharge
- Cramping, discharge (few weeks)
- Avoid intercourse until bleeding stops

**Outcomes**:
- Amenorrhea: 30-50%
- Reduced bleeding: 80-90%
- Satisfaction: 75-90%
- **Failure**: 20-30% require repeat procedure or hysterectomy

**Complications**:
- Uterine perforation (1-2%)
- Fluid overload (first-generation)
- Infection (<1%)
- Hematometra (cervical stenosis)
- Pregnancy (use reliable contraception, high-risk pregnancy if occurs)

#### Hysterectomy

**Indications**:
- Failed conservative management
- Adenomyosis
- Desire for definitive treatment
- Patient preference

**Outcomes**:
- 100% cure for bleeding
- High satisfaction
- (See hysterectomy techniques in other sections)

## Chronic Pelvic Pain

### Overview
- Non-cyclic pain >6 months duration
- Significantly impacts quality of life
- Multifactorial etiology (gynecologic, urologic, gastrointestinal, musculoskeletal, psychological)

### Gynecologic Causes
- Endometriosis (most common gynecologic cause)
- Adhesions
- Adenomyosis
- Chronic PID
- Ovarian remnant syndrome
- Pelvic congestion syndrome (varicose veins)

### Surgical Management

**Diagnostic Laparoscopy**:
- Identify and treat pathology
- Lysis of adhesions
- Excision of endometriosis
- Presacral neurectomy (severe midline pain)
- Ovarian cystectomy

**Hysterectomy**:
- Consider if gynecologic source confirmed
- More effective if combined with BSO for endometriosis
- **Success**: 70-80% improvement (but not 100%)
- Must address all pain sources (multidisciplinary approach)

**Laparoscopic Uterosacral Nerve Ablation (LUNA)**:
- Transect uterosacral ligaments
- Conflicting data on efficacy
- Presacral neurectomy more effective but higher complication rate

## Key Points

- Uterine fibroids are common; treatment depends on symptoms, fertility desires, and fibroid characteristics
- Myomectomy preserves fertility but fibroids may recur
- Hysterectomy is definitive treatment for fibroids without desire for fertility
- Endometriosis is chronic, often recurs, requires long-term management strategy
- Surgical excision of endometriosis improves pain and fertility in select cases
- Most ovarian cysts in reproductive-age women are functional and resolve spontaneously
- Cystectomy preferred over oophorectomy to preserve ovarian function
- Abnormal uterine bleeding requires structural evaluation before endometrial ablation
- Endometrial ablation effective alternative to hysterectomy for heavy bleeding
- Chronic pelvic pain requires multidisciplinary evaluation and treatment
- Minimally invasive surgery preferred when feasible for most benign conditions
