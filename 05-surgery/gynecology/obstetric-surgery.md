# Obstetric Surgery

## Overview

Obstetric surgery encompasses procedures performed during pregnancy, labor, delivery, and the postpartum period. The most common obstetric surgery is cesarean section, performed in approximately 32% of US deliveries. Other procedures include operative vaginal delivery, surgical management of ectopic pregnancy, cervical cerclage, postpartum hemorrhage interventions, and management of pregnancy complications. Obstetric surgery requires consideration of both maternal and fetal wellbeing, balancing risks and benefits for two patients simultaneously.

## Cesarean Section

### Overview
- Most common major surgery in US (1.2 million annually)
- Rate: ~32% of deliveries (varies by institution 15-40%)
- **Goal**: Safe delivery of infant while minimizing maternal morbidity

### Indications

**Absolute Indications**:
- Placenta previa (complete)
- Vasa previa
- Umbilical cord prolapse
- Prior classical (vertical) uterine incision
- Some uterine anomalies
- Obstructing pelvic mass
- Active genital herpes (debated)

**Common Relative Indications**:
- **Fetal**:
  - Non-reassuring fetal heart rate tracing
  - Malpresentation (breech, transverse lie)
  - Macrosomia (>4500-5000g, especially with diabetes)
- **Maternal**:
  - Prior cesarean delivery (trial of labor vs. repeat cesarean)
  - Cephalopelvic disproportion
  - Failed labor induction
  - Arrest of dilation or descent
  - Maternal request (controversial)
- **Placental**:
  - Placental abruption (if fetal compromise)
  - Placenta accreta spectrum

### Preoperative Preparation

**Consent**:
- Risks, benefits, alternatives
- Discuss future pregnancies (VBAC vs. repeat cesarean)

**Anesthesia**:
- **Neuraxial** (preferred): Spinal or epidural
  - Allows maternal participation
  - Lower aspiration risk
  - Better pain control
- **General**: If emergent, contraindication to neuraxial, patient preference
  - Rapid sequence intubation
  - Higher aspiration risk
  - Neonatal depression risk

**Antibiotics**:
- Single dose within 60 minutes before incision
- **Cefazolin** 2g IV (3g if >120kg) or
- **Clindamycin + gentamicin** if penicillin allergy

**Thromboprophylaxis**:
- Sequential compression devices intraoperatively
- Pharmacologic prophylaxis if high risk (obesity, prior VTE, thrombophilia)

**Bladder Drainage**:
- Foley catheter placement

**Skin Preparation**:
- Chlorhexidine-alcohol (preferred) or povidone-iodine

### Surgical Technique

**Patient Positioning**:
- Supine with left lateral tilt (displace uterus off vena cava)
- Arms extended or tucked

**Incision Types**:

**Skin Incision**:
- **Pfannenstiel** (low transverse): Most common
  - Curved suprapubic incision
  - Better cosmesis, less pain, lower hernia rate
  - Adequate exposure for most cases
- **Joel-Cohen**: Straight transverse (2-3cm below line between ASIS)
  - Faster, less blood loss
  - Used in some evidence-based protocols
- **Vertical midline**:
  - Better exposure (large fetus, lower segment not formed, placenta previa)
  - Higher hernia rate, more pain

**Uterine Incision**:
- **Low transverse** (Kerr): Standard (>95% of cases)
  - Lower uterine segment
  - Less bleeding, easier repair
  - Lower dehiscence/rupture risk in future pregnancies
- **Classical** (vertical):
  - Indications: Preterm (<28 weeks, lower segment not formed), transverse lie, fibroids, placenta previa anterior
  - Higher bleeding, more difficult repair
  - Precludes VBAC (high rupture risk)
- **Low vertical**:
  - Rarely used
  - Can extend classically if needed

**Surgical Steps** (Low Transverse):

1. **Skin incision**: Pfannenstiel or Joel-Cohen
2. **Subcutaneous dissection**: Dissect to fascia
3. **Fascial incision**: Transverse incision of anterior rectus sheath
4. **Fascial elevation**: Bluntly dissect fascia off rectus muscles (superior and inferior)
5. **Rectus muscle separation**: Blunt separation in midline
6. **Peritoneal entry**: Incise peritoneum superiorly, extend
7. **Bladder flap** (optional, controversial):
   - Incise vesicouterine peritoneum
   - Bluntly dissect bladder inferiorly off lower uterine segment
   - May reduce bladder injury, but increases operative time
8. **Uterine incision**:
   - Transverse incision in lower uterine segment (2-3cm)
   - Bluntly or sharply extend laterally (curved)
   - Avoid angles (reduce bleeding, easier repair)
9. **Delivery of infant**:
   - Hand into uterus, deliver head (scoop under occiput, flex)
   - Fundal pressure by assistant
   - Suction mouth and nose
   - Deliver shoulders and body
   - Clamp and cut cord
10. **Deliver placenta**: Manual extraction or gentle traction
11. **Oxytocin administration**:
    - Oxytocin 30-40 units in 1L IV (continuous infusion) or
    - Carbetocin 100mcg IV (single dose, if available)
    - Reduces postpartum hemorrhage
12. **Uterine repair**:
    - **Single-layer** vs. **double-layer**: Controversial (single faster, double may be thicker)
    - Running, locking suture (0 or 1 absorbable - Vicryl, PDS)
    - Ensure hemostasis
    - **Exteriorization** vs. **in situ**: Controversial (in situ less nausea, pain; exteriorization easier access, similar outcomes)
13. **Inspect adnexa**: Visualize tubes and ovaries
14. **Peritoneal closure**: Not necessary (non-closure faster, no difference in outcomes)
15. **Fascial closure**: Running or interrupted suture (0 or 1 absorbable)
16. **Subcutaneous closure**: If >2cm depth (reduces wound complications)
17. **Skin closure**: Staples or subcuticular suture (suture lower wound complications)

**Variations**:
- **Misgav-Ladach/Joel-Cohen technique**: Modified technique
  - Straight transverse skin incision
  - Minimal sharp dissection (blunt dissection)
  - Single-layer uterine closure
  - No peritoneal closure
  - Faster, less blood loss, less pain (some studies)

### Postoperative Care

**Immediate**:
- Monitor vital signs, vaginal bleeding
- Assess uterine tone (fundal massage if boggy)
- Pain management (NSAIDs + opioids initially, transition to oral)

**Hospital Stay**: 2-4 days typically

**Foley Removal**: 6-12 hours postoperatively (once ambulatory)

**Diet**: Advance as tolerated (early feeding reduces ileus)

**Ambulation**: Early mobilization (reduces VTE, ileus)

**Thromboprophylaxis**: Continue if indicated

**Wound Care**: Keep clean and dry, remove staples/sutures at 1 week

**Activity**: Avoid heavy lifting 4-6 weeks, driving when comfortable (1-2 weeks)

**Follow-Up**: 2 weeks (wound check), 6 weeks (postpartum visit)

### Outcomes

**Maternal**:
- Mortality: 3-4 per 100,000 cesareans (higher than vaginal delivery)
- Longer recovery than vaginal delivery
- Future pregnancy risks (placenta accreta, uterine rupture, placenta previa)

**Neonatal**:
- **Transient tachypnea of newborn**: More common (retained lung fluid)
- **Respiratory distress**: Higher if elective before 39 weeks

### Complications

**Intraoperative** (5-10%):
- **Bleeding** (1-7%):
  - Uterine atony (see postpartum hemorrhage section)
  - Uterine artery laceration
  - Rarely requires transfusion (1-2%)
- **Bladder injury** (0.5-1%):
  - Higher with prior cesarean, emergency, bladder flap
  - Recognize and repair (two-layer closure, prolonged catheter drainage)
- **Bowel injury** (<0.1%): Adhesions from prior surgery
- **Ureteral injury** (rare <0.1%)

**Postoperative**:
- **Endometritis** (5-10% unscheduled, 1-2% scheduled with antibiotics):
  - Fever, uterine tenderness
  - Broad-spectrum antibiotics
- **Wound infection/dehiscence** (2-5%):
  - Higher with obesity, diabetes, emergency
- **Ileus** (2-5%): Bowel dysfunction
- **VTE** (1-2 per 1000):
  - Higher risk than vaginal delivery
  - Prophylaxis essential
- **Chronic pain** (5-15%): Incisional pain
- **Adhesions**: Future surgery complicated

**Long-Term**:
- **Uterine scar**: Risks in future pregnancies
- **Placenta accreta spectrum** (0.2% first cesarean, increases with each subsequent cesarean)
- **Placenta previa**: 2-3x increased risk
- **Uterine rupture in VBAC**: 0.5-1% (low transverse), 4-9% (classical)

### Vaginal Birth After Cesarean (VBAC)

**Trial of Labor After Cesarean (TOLAC)**:
- Attempt vaginal delivery after prior cesarean
- Success rate: 60-80% (varies by indication, patient factors)

**Candidates**:
- One prior low transverse cesarean
- No other uterine scars or rupture
- Adequate pelvis
- No contraindications to vaginal delivery
- Continuous fetal monitoring available
- Immediate cesarean capability

**Contraindications**:
- Prior classical or T-shaped incision (high rupture risk)
- Prior uterine rupture
- Extensive transfundal surgery (e.g., myomectomy)
- Contraindication to vaginal delivery

**Benefits of Successful VBAC**:
- Avoid repeat surgery
- Shorter recovery
- Lower infection risk
- Reduced risk in future pregnancies (no additional scars)

**Risks**:
- **Uterine rupture** (0.5-1%):
  - Catastrophic complication
  - Fetal death/brain injury, maternal hemorrhage
  - Requires emergent cesarean, often hysterectomy
- **Failed TOLAC**: Emergency cesarean (higher morbidity than planned cesarean)

**Counseling**:
- Discuss risks and benefits
- Shared decision-making
- Document discussion

## Operative Vaginal Delivery

### Overview
- Forceps or vacuum-assisted vaginal delivery
- Declining use (3-4% of deliveries)
- Alternative to cesarean for prolonged second stage

### Indications

**Maternal**:
- Exhaustion
- Prolonged second stage (nulliparous >3 hours with epidural, multiparous >2 hours)
- Medical condition precluding prolonged pushing (cardiac disease, cerebral aneurysm)

**Fetal**:
- Non-reassuring fetal heart rate tracing

### Prerequisites
- Full dilation
- Ruptured membranes
- Engaged head (at least 0 station)
- Known position
- Adequate pelvis
- Empty bladder
- Adequate anesthesia

### Classification (Station)
- **Outlet**: Scalp visible, head at perineum
- **Low**: Station ≥+2cm
- **Mid**: Station 0 to +2cm
- **High**: Above 0 station (not attempted)

### Forceps Delivery

**Types of Forceps**:
- **Outlet forceps** (Simpson, Elliott): Classic forceps
- **Rotational forceps** (Kielland): Rotate head (rarely used now)

**Technique**:
1. Confirm prerequisites
2. Apply blades (left blade first, then right)
3. Check application (sagittal suture perpendicular, even on sides)
4. Gentle traction with contractions and maternal effort
5. **Direction**: Curve of Carus (downward, then upward as head crowns)
6. Deliver head, remove forceps
7. Deliver shoulders and body

**Complications**:
- **Maternal**: Vaginal/perineal lacerations (20-30%), hematoma, pelvic floor injury
- **Neonatal**: Facial bruising/lacerations (common, minor), facial nerve palsy (1-2%, usually transient), skull fracture (rare), intracranial hemorrhage (rare)

### Vacuum Delivery

**Advantages**:
- Less maternal trauma than forceps
- Easier to apply
- Less anesthesia needed

**Technique**:
1. Apply cup to flexion point (posterior fontanelle)
2. Check for tissue (no vaginal/cervical tissue between cup and scalp)
3. Create suction (up to 550-600 mmHg)
4. Traction with contractions and maternal effort
5. **Direction**: Curve of Carus
6. If cup pops off 3 times, abandon attempt

**Complications**:
- **Maternal**: Less trauma than forceps
- **Neonatal**: Caput succedaneum (scalp swelling - universal), cephalohematoma (5-10%), subgaleal hemorrhage (rare but serious), retinal hemorrhage (common, resolves)

**Contraindications**:
- Preterm (<34 weeks)
- Fetal coagulopathy

### Trial of Operative Vaginal Delivery
- Attempt forceps/vacuum with cesarean backup
- Abandon if no progress after 3 pulls or 20 minutes

### Sequential Instruments
- Switching from vacuum to forceps or vice versa
- Increases neonatal trauma risk
- Should be avoided if possible

## Postpartum Hemorrhage Management

### Definition
- Blood loss >500mL vaginal delivery, >1000mL cesarean
- Or blood loss causing hemodynamic instability

### Etiology (4 T's)
- **Tone** (70%): Uterine atony
- **Trauma** (20%): Lacerations, uterine rupture
- **Tissue** (10%): Retained placenta, invasive placenta
- **Thrombin** (<1%): Coagulopathy

### Medical Management

**Uterotonic Agents**:
- **Oxytocin**:
  - 10-40 units/L IV continuous or 10 units IM
  - First-line
- **Methylergonovine** (Methergine):
  - 0.2mg IM (can repeat q2-4h)
  - Contraindication: Hypertension (causes vasoconstriction)
- **Carboprost** (Hemabate):
  - 250mcg IM (can repeat q15min, max 2mg)
  - Contraindication: Asthma
- **Misoprostol**:
  - 800-1000mcg rectally or sublingually
  - Side effects: Fever, chills

**Tranexamic Acid**:
- 1g IV over 10 minutes
- Antifibrinolytic
- Reduces bleeding, mortality (WOMAN trial)

### Surgical Management

**Uterine Tamponade**:
- **Intrauterine balloon**: Bakri balloon, Foley catheter with 30-60mL balloon
- Inflate in uterus (up to 500mL saline)
- Apply external compression
- Success: 80-90% for atony
- Leave 12-24 hours

**Uterine Compression Sutures**:
- **B-Lynch suture**: Brace suture around uterus
- **Cho suture**: Interrupted compression sutures
- Compress uterine muscle, reduce bleeding
- Preserves uterus

**Uterine Artery Ligation**:
- Ligate uterine arteries bilaterally
- At level of lower uterine segment
- Preserves uterus, allows future pregnancy
- Success: 80-90%

**Hypogastric Artery Ligation**:
- Ligate internal iliac arteries
- Technically challenging
- Success: 50-70%
- Risk of ureteral injury

**Hysterectomy** (Last Resort):
- Peripartum hysterectomy
- **Indications**: Failed conservative measures, life-threatening hemorrhage, placenta accreta
- Supracervical if possible (faster, less bleeding)
- Total if cervical pathology
- **Complications**: Bladder/ureter injury, need for transfusion, infection

**Interventional Radiology**:
- **Uterine artery embolization**:
  - If hemodynamically stable
  - Arterial catheterization, inject embolic particles
  - Success: 85-95%
  - Preserves uterus

## Ectopic Pregnancy

### Overview
- Implantation outside uterine cavity
- 1-2% of pregnancies
- Leading cause of maternal mortality in first trimester
- **Location**: Ampulla of fallopian tube (70%), isthmus (12%), fimbria (11%), ovary (3%), cornual/interstitial (2-3%), cervix (<1%), abdominal (<1%)

### Risk Factors
- Prior ectopic pregnancy (10-fold increased risk)
- Prior tubal surgery (salpingostomy, tubal ligation)
- PID/salpingitis
- Smoking
- Infertility, assisted reproduction
- IUD use (shifts ratio toward ectopic if pregnancy occurs)

### Diagnosis

**Clinical Presentation**:
- Abdominal/pelvic pain (90%)
- Vaginal bleeding (75%)
- Amenorrhea (75%)
- Hemodynamically unstable if ruptured

**Laboratory**:
- **β-hCG**:
  - Positive pregnancy test
  - Quantitative level to correlate with ultrasound
  - Abnormal rise (should double q48h if viable IUP)
- **Progesterone**: <5 ng/mL suggests non-viable
- **Type and screen**: Prepare for possible transfusion

**Imaging**:
- **Transvaginal ultrasound**:
  - **IUP** (rules out ectopic in >99%, except heterotopic pregnancy risk 1:4000, higher with ART)
  - **Discriminatory zone**: β-hCG level above which IUP should be visible (~1500-2000 mIU/mL)
  - **Ectopic findings**: Adnexal mass, extrauterine gestational sac, cardiac activity, free fluid (blood)
  - **Empty uterus** with β-hCG above discriminatory zone: Ectopic until proven otherwise

### Management

**Expectant Management**:
- Declining β-hCG levels (spontaneous resolution)
- Hemodynamically stable
- No evidence of rupture
- Reliable patient
- Success: 70-90% if initial β-hCG <200 mIU/mL

**Medical Management** (Methotrexate):

**Indications**:
- Hemodynamically stable
- No rupture
- Mass <3-4cm
- No fetal cardiac activity
- β-hCG <5000 mIU/mL (some use higher cutoffs)
- Normal liver/kidney function, normal blood counts
- Reliable patient (follow-up compliance)

**Regimen**:
- **Single-dose**: Methotrexate 50mg/m² IM
  - Check β-hCG on days 4 and 7 (expect 15% decrease between days 4-7)
  - If inadequate decrease: Repeat dose or surgery
  - Weekly β-hCG until undetectable
- **Multi-dose**: Methotrexate 1mg/kg IM alternating with leucovorin (higher success but more side effects)

**Contraindications**:
- Hemodynamic instability
- Contraindications to methotrexate (renal/liver disease, blood dyscrasias, immunodeficiency)
- Breastfeeding
- Unreliable follow-up
- Large mass, cardiac activity, high β-hCG (relative)

**Success**: 85-95% (single-dose), higher with multi-dose

**Monitoring**:
- Weekly β-hCG until undetectable
- Watch for rupture (pain, hemodynamic changes) - occurs in ~5-10%

**Side Effects**:
- Abdominal pain (separation pain day 1-3)
- Stomatitis, nausea, diarrhea
- Bone marrow suppression (rare with single dose)

**Precautions**:
- Avoid alcohol, NSAIDs, vitamins with folate
- Reliable contraception for 3 months

**Surgical Management**:

**Indications**:
- Hemodynamic instability
- Rupture or impending rupture
- Contraindication to methotrexate
- Failed medical management
- Patient preference

**Laparoscopy** (Preferred):
- Less morbidity than laparotomy
- Faster recovery

**Laparotomy**:
- If hemodynamically unstable
- Extensive adhesions
- Large ectopic (difficult laparoscopic access)

**Salpingostomy** (Conservative):
- **Indications**: Unruptured ectopic, desire for fertility, normal contralateral tube
- **Technique**:
  1. Identify ectopic pregnancy in tube
  2. Linear incision over ectopic (antimesosalpinx border)
  3. Remove products of conception (suction/forceps)
  4. Irrigate, achieve hemostasis
  5. Leave incision open (heals by secondary intention)
- **Outcomes**: Preserves tube, 60-80% future IUP, 10-15% repeat ectopic
- **Persistent trophoblast**: 5-10% (monitor β-hCG weekly until undetectable, may need methotrexate)

**Salpingectomy** (Definitive):
- **Indications**: Ruptured ectopic, extensive tubal damage, recurrent ectopic in same tube, completed childbearing, unstable
- **Technique**:
  1. Identify ectopic in tube
  2. Coagulate/ligate tube at sites of resection
  3. Remove segment of tube containing ectopic (or entire tube)
- **Outcomes**: Definitive treatment, lower persistent trophoblast (1-2%), future pregnancy requires contralateral tube or IVF

**Special Locations**:
- **Cornual/interstitial**: High rupture risk, often requires cornual resection or hysterectomy
- **Cervical**: Uterine artery embolization + methotrexate or surgical evacuation (high bleeding risk)
- **Ovarian**: Oophorectomy or wedge resection
- **Abdominal**: Laparotomy for removal

**Postoperative Care**:
- Monitor β-hCG weekly until undetectable (after salpingostomy)
- RhoGAM if Rh-negative

## Cervical Cerclage

### Overview
- Surgical reinforcement of cervix
- Prevent preterm birth due to cervical insufficiency
- Placed transvaginally (McDonald, Shirodkar) or abdominally (rare)

### Indications

**History-Indicated** (Elective):
- History of cervical insufficiency (painless cervical dilation and delivery in 2nd trimester)
- Prior cerclage
- Placed 12-14 weeks

**Ultrasound-Indicated**:
- Short cervix (<25mm) on transvaginal ultrasound before 24 weeks in patient with prior preterm birth
- Placed when diagnosed

**Physical Exam-Indicated** (Emergency/Rescue):
- Cervical dilation (1-4cm) with visible membranes in 2nd trimester
- No contractions, no infection
- Highest risk of complications

### Contraindications
- Active vaginal bleeding
- Ruptured membranes
- Chorioamnionitis
- Active labor
- Fetal anomalies incompatible with life
- Placenta previa

### Types

**McDonald Cerclage** (Most Common):
- Purse-string suture around cervix (high on ectocervix)
- Easier to place and remove
- Non-absorbable suture (Mersilene tape)
- Removed at 36-37 weeks or labor

**Shirodkar Cerclage**:
- Submucosal placement (higher on cervix)
- Incise vaginal mucosa, place suture, close mucosa
- More difficult technique
- Theoretically stronger (not proven superior)

**Transabdominal Cerclage**:
- Suture at cervicoisthmic junction (via laparotomy or laparoscopy)
- Indications: Failed vaginal cerclage, very short or absent cervix
- Permanent (requires cesarean delivery)

### Technique (McDonald Cerclage):
1. **Positioning**: Dorsal lithotomy, steep Trendelenburg
2. **Reduce membranes** (if bulging): Foley balloon or forceps
3. **Place suture**: Non-absorbable (Mersilene tape)
   - 4-5 bites circumferentially around cervix (high on ectocervix, avoid bladder anteriorly)
   - Avoid 3 and 9 o'clock (vascular)
4. **Tie suture**: Snug but not too tight
5. **Cut tails**: Leave long for easy identification at removal

### Postoperative Care
- **Activity**: Pelvic rest until delivery
- **Tocolytics**: Not routinely used (if contractions, short course)
- **Antibiotics**: Prophylactic dose
- **Follow-up**: Serial ultrasound to monitor cervical length, fetal growth
- **Removal**: 36-37 weeks (vaginal delivery allowed) or labor/rupture

### Outcomes
- **Success** (delivery ≥37 weeks): 75-90% (history-indicated), lower for exam-indicated
- Prolongs gestation by average 4-6 weeks

### Complications
- Membrane rupture (1-2%)
- Chorioamnionitis (1-7%)
- Cervical laceration (delivery with cerclage in place)
- Bleeding
- Suture displacement

## Key Points

- Cesarean section is most common major surgery in US (32% of deliveries)
- Low transverse uterine incision is standard, allows VBAC
- Prophylactic antibiotics reduce postoperative infection
- Trial of labor after cesarean has 60-80% success but carries 0.5-1% uterine rupture risk
- Operative vaginal delivery (forceps or vacuum) is alternative to cesarean for prolonged second stage
- Postpartum hemorrhage most often caused by uterine atony
- Surgical management of PPH ranges from tamponade to hysterectomy
- Ectopic pregnancy can be managed expectantly, medically (methotrexate), or surgically
- Salpingostomy preserves tube but has higher persistent trophoblast risk
- Cervical cerclage prevents preterm birth in cervical insufficiency
- McDonald cerclage is most common, placed 12-14 weeks, removed 36-37 weeks
