# Pelvic Floor Disorders

## Overview

Pelvic floor disorders include pelvic organ prolapse (POP), urinary incontinence, and fecal incontinence, affecting approximately 25% of women in the United States. These conditions result from weakness or damage to pelvic floor muscles, fascia, and connective tissue, significantly impacting quality of life. Risk factors include vaginal childbirth, aging, obesity, chronic constipation, and genetic predisposition. Surgical management aims to restore anatomy, improve function, and enhance quality of life while minimizing complications and recurrence.

### Pelvic Floor Anatomy

**Support Structures**:
- **Levator ani muscles**: Pubococcygeus, puborectalis, iliococcygeus
- **Endopelvic fascia**: Connective tissue support
- **Ligaments**: Uterosacral, cardinal ligaments
- **Perineal body**: Central tendon of perineum

**Three Levels of Support** (DeLancey):
- **Level I** (Apical): Uterosacral/cardinal ligament complex suspends cervix/vaginal apex
- **Level II** (Mid-vagina): Lateral attachment to arcus tendineus fascia pelvis
- **Level III** (Distal): Fusion of vagina to perineal body, urogenital diaphragm

## Pelvic Organ Prolapse

### Overview
- Descent of pelvic organs through vaginal canal
- Affects 50% of parous women (clinically significant in 10-20%)
- Lifetime risk of surgery: 12-19%
- Recurrence after surgery: 30% at 5 years

### Risk Factors
- **Childbirth**: Vaginal delivery (strongest risk factor)
  - Forceps delivery, prolonged second stage, large baby
- **Aging**: Hormonal changes, tissue weakening
- **Obesity**: Increased intra-abdominal pressure
- **Chronic increased intra-abdominal pressure**: Constipation, COPD, heavy lifting
- **Prior hysterectomy**: Disrupts apical support
- **Genetic factors**: Connective tissue disorders (Ehlers-Danlos)
- **Prior pelvic surgery**: Radiation, surgery

### Classification (POP-Q System)

**Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantification (POP-Q)**:
- Standardized objective measurement system
- Nine measurements (6 vaginal points, 2 reference points, genital hiatus, perineal body)
- **Stages** (based on most dependent portion):
  - **Stage 0**: No prolapse
  - **Stage I**: Most distal point >1cm above hymen
  - **Stage II**: Most distal point between 1cm above and 1cm below hymen
  - **Stage III**: Most distal point >1cm below hymen but not complete eversion
  - **Stage IV**: Complete eversion of vagina

### Types of Prolapse

**Anterior Vaginal Wall** (Cystocele):
- Descent of bladder
- Most common type (35%)
- **Symptoms**: Vaginal bulge, incomplete bladder emptying, urinary retention

**Posterior Vaginal Wall** (Rectocele):
- Descent of rectum
- 20% of prolapse cases
- **Symptoms**: Vaginal bulge, constipation, need to splint (manual reduction) to defecate

**Apical** (Uterine Prolapse or Vaginal Vault Prolapse):
- Descent of uterus/cervix or post-hysterectomy vaginal apex
- Often combined with anterior/posterior defects
- **Symptoms**: Vaginal bulge, pelvic pressure

**Enterocele**:
- Herniation of small bowel into vagina
- Often coexists with vault prolapse
- **Symptoms**: Vaginal bulge, pelvic pressure

### Clinical Presentation

**Symptoms**:
- **Vaginal bulge/pressure**: Most common complaint
- **Pelvic heaviness**: Worse with standing, end of day
- **Urinary symptoms**: Frequency, urgency, retention, stress incontinence
- **Bowel symptoms**: Constipation, incomplete evacuation, splinting
- **Sexual dysfunction**: Dyspareunia, avoidance
- **Back pain**: Lower back discomfort

**Examination**:
- **Inspection**: Visible bulge, vaginal rugae (absent suggests atrophy)
- **Valsalva examination**: Maximal descent with straining
- **POP-Q measurements**: Standardized assessment
- **Baden-Walker Classification**: 0-4 grading (simpler, less precise)

### Diagnostic Evaluation

**History**:
- Severity of symptoms (validated questionnaires: PFDI-20, PFIQ-7)
- Impact on quality of life
- Previous treatments
- Medical/surgical history
- Childbirth history

**Physical Examination**:
- POP-Q measurements
- Bimanual examination (assess for masses)
- Assess pelvic floor muscle strength
- Rectal examination

**Urodynamic Testing**:
- Not routine for all patients
- **Indications**:
  - Concurrent urinary symptoms
  - Failed prior surgery
  - Occult stress incontinence evaluation (prolapse reduction with cough)
- **Components**: Cystometry, uroflowmetry, post-void residual

**Imaging**:
- **Rarely needed**: Clinical examination sufficient
- **Defecography**: Severe posterior prolapse, rectal outlet obstruction
- **MRI**: Dynamic pelvic floor imaging (research/complex cases)

### Conservative Management

**Pelvic Floor Physical Therapy** (Kegel exercises):
- Strengthen pelvic floor muscles
- **Indications**: Mild prolapse (stage I-II), motivated patient
- **Efficacy**: Improves symptoms in 50-70%, rarely improves POP-Q stage
- **Duration**: 3-6 months of supervised therapy
- Biofeedback enhances compliance

**Pessaries**:
- Mechanical support devices (intravaginal)
- **Indications**:
  - Any stage prolapse
  - Trial before surgery
  - Poor surgical candidate
  - Desire to avoid surgery
  - Pregnancy

**Types**:
- **Support pessaries**: Ring, Gellhorn (most common)
  - Ring: Easiest to insert/remove (patient managed)
  - Gellhorn: Better support but harder to remove (provider managed)
- **Space-filling**: Donut, cube, inflatable
- **Continence pessaries**: Ring with support, incontinence dish

**Fitting**:
- Trial fitting (multiple sizes)
- Patient comfort assessment
- Ability to remove (if self-managed)

**Management**:
- **Follow-up**: Every 3-6 months
- **Cleaning**: Remove, clean, reinsert (patient or provider)
- **Vaginal estrogen**: Reduce erosion/irritation
- **Complications**: Vaginal erosion/ulceration (5-10%), discharge, UTI, difficulty removing

**Outcomes**:
- **Success**: 50-75% continue use long-term
- **Satisfaction**: 60-90%
- **Discontinuation**: Discomfort, inability to manage, inadequate relief

**Vaginal Estrogen**:
- Topical estrogen cream or pessary
- Improves vaginal tissue health (atrophy common in postmenopausal women)
- Enhances surgical outcomes
- Reduces pessary-related complications

### Surgical Management

#### Anterior Repair (Anterior Colporrhaphy)

**Indications**: Symptomatic anterior vaginal wall prolapse (cystocele)

**Technique**:
1. **Incision**: Midline vaginal incision (anterior vaginal wall)
2. **Dissection**: Separate vaginal epithelium from underlying pubocervical fascia
3. **Plication**: Midline plication of fascia with delayed absorbable suture
4. **Excision**: Trim redundant vaginal epithelium
5. **Closure**: Close vaginal epithelium

**Mesh Augmentation** (Transvaginal Mesh):
- **FDA Warning (2019)**: Serious complications led to market removal of most products
- **Complications**: Erosion, pain, dyspareunia, infection, urinary complications
- **Current use**: Very limited, informed consent essential
- Native tissue repair preferred

**Outcomes**:
- **Anatomic success**: 60-80% at 2 years
- **Symptom improvement**: 70-85%
- **Recurrence**: 30-40% at 5 years

**Complications**:
- Bladder injury (1-3%)
- Urinary retention (5-10%, usually temporary)
- Dyspareunia (10-15%)
- Recurrence (30-40%)
- Mesh complications if mesh used (10-20%)

#### Posterior Repair (Posterior Colporrhaphy)

**Indications**: Symptomatic posterior vaginal wall prolapse (rectocele)

**Technique**:
1. **Incision**: Midline posterior vaginal wall incision
2. **Dissection**: Separate vaginal epithelium from underlying rectovaginal fascia
3. **Fascial plication**: Midline plication of fascia
4. **Levator plication**: Optional (narrows genital hiatus but may cause dyspareunia)
5. **Perineorrhaphy**: Rebuild perineal body (if deficient)
6. **Excision**: Trim excess vaginal epithelium
7. **Closure**: Close vaginal epithelium

**Site-Specific Repair**:
- Identify and repair discrete fascial defects
- Alternative to midline plication
- May reduce dyspareunia

**Outcomes**:
- **Anatomic success**: 70-85%
- **Symptom improvement**: 75-90%
- **Dyspareunia**: 10-20% (higher with levator plication)

**Complications**:
- Rectal injury (<1%)
- Dyspareunia (10-20%)
- Recurrence (20-30%)

#### Apical Suspension Procedures

**Vaginal Approach**:

**Uterosacral Ligament Suspension** (USLS):
- **Indications**: Post-hysterectomy vault prolapse or at time of hysterectomy
- **Technique**:
  1. Identify uterosacral ligaments at ischial spine level
  2. Place sutures through ligaments (2-3 sutures per side)
  3. Attach to vaginal apex (cuff)
  4. Suture closure
  5. Cystoscopy to ensure no ureteral kinking
- **Outcomes**: 85-95% anatomic success at 2 years
- **Complications**: Ureteral obstruction (1-10%, check with cystoscopy), bleeding, nerve injury

**Sacrospinous Ligament Fixation** (SSLF):
- **Indications**: Vaginal vault prolapse
- **Technique**:
  1. Dissect pararectal space
  2. Identify sacrospinous ligament (anterior to coccygeus muscle)
  3. Place sutures through ligament (1-2cm medial to ischial spine, avoid pudendal vessels/nerve)
  4. Attach to vaginal apex
- **Outcomes**: 80-90% success at 2 years
- **Complications**: Bleeding (gluteal vessels), nerve injury (pudendal, sciatic), buttock pain (10-15%, usually temporary)

**Iliococcygeus Suspension**:
- Alternative to sacrospinous
- Suture apex to iliococcygeus fascia
- Lower risk of nerve injury

**Abdominal Approach**:

**Abdominal Sacral Colpopexy** (Open, Laparoscopic, or Robotic):
- **Gold standard** for apical prolapse
- **Highest success rates** (90-95% at 5 years)

**Indications**:
- Vaginal vault prolapse
- Uterine prolapse (with or without hysterectomy)
- Recurrent prolapse after vaginal surgery
- Desire for most durable repair

**Technique** (Robotic Sacral Colpopexy):
1. **Port placement**: 4-5 ports
2. **Anterior dissection**: Mobilize bladder off anterior vagina
3. **Posterior dissection**: Enter rectovaginal space, mobilize rectum
4. **Mesh placement**:
   - Y-shaped polypropylene mesh
   - Attach anterior arm to anterior vagina (sutures)
   - Attach posterior arm to posterior vagina
   - Ensure full-length vaginal support
5. **Sacral promontory dissection**: Expose anterior longitudinal ligament (below sacral promontory)
6. **Mesh attachment to sacrum**: Suture or tack mesh to sacrum
7. **Peritoneal closure**: Bury mesh under peritoneum (reduce erosion risk)
8. **Optional procedures**: Concomitant hysterectomy, anti-incontinence procedure

**Concurrent Hysterectomy**:
- **Supracervical hysterectomy**: Preferred (less risk of mesh erosion, shorter operative time)
- **Total hysterectomy**: If uterine pathology

**Postoperative Care**:
- Hospital stay: 23-hour or 1-2 days
- Pelvic rest 6-8 weeks
- Lifting restrictions 6-8 weeks
- Resume activity gradually

**Outcomes**:
- **Anatomic success**: 90-95% at 5 years (best of all procedures)
- **Symptom improvement**: 85-95%
- **Recurrence**: 5-10% at 5 years
- **Patient satisfaction**: >90%

**Complications**:
- **Mesh erosion/exposure** (3-10%):
  - Vaginal (more common), bladder, rectal (rare)
  - Higher with total hysterectomy vs. supracervical
  - Treatment: Estrogen, partial excision (small), surgical repair (large)
- **Bleeding**: Presacral veins (can be difficult to control)
- **Bowel injury** (<1%)
- **Urinary retention** (5-10%, usually temporary)
- **De novo stress incontinence** (5-10%)
- **Constipation**: If posterior mesh too tight

**Mesh Controversy**:
- FDA warnings focused on transvaginal mesh (not sacral colpopexy)
- Sacral colpopexy remains safe, effective with informed consent
- Polypropylene mesh standard

#### Obliterative Procedures

**Colpocleisis**:
- **Indications**:
  - Elderly, frail patients (poor surgical candidates)
  - No desire for future vaginal intercourse
  - Advanced prolapse
- **Technique**: Close vagina (LeFort partial colpocleisis or complete colpocleisis)
- **Advantages**: Shortest procedure, lowest morbidity, high success (>95%)
- **Disadvantages**: Eliminates vaginal intercourse, difficult to access uterus (need concurrent hysterectomy or ablation)
- **Outcomes**: >95% success, high satisfaction in appropriate patients

### Combined Procedures

**Multi-Compartment Prolapse**:
- Often requires combination of procedures
- Anterior + posterior + apical repair common
- Address all symptomatic compartments
- Apical support critical (supports anterior and posterior)

**Concomitant Anti-Incontinence Procedures**:
- **Occult stress incontinence**: 30-50% develop SUI after prolapse repair
- **Prophylactic sling**: Controversial (balance benefit vs. complications)
- **Options**: Perform if stress incontinence demonstrated with prolapse reduction

### Postoperative Care (General)

**Hospital Stay**:
- Vaginal procedures: Same-day or 23-hour
- Abdominal (open): 2-3 days
- Laparoscopic/robotic: 23-hour or 1-2 days

**Catheter Management**:
- Voiding trial before discharge (or next day)
- Self-catheterization if retention (teach before discharge)
- Most resolve within days to weeks

**Activity Restrictions**:
- Pelvic rest: 6-8 weeks (no intercourse, tampons, douching)
- No heavy lifting (>10 lbs): 6-8 weeks
- Avoid constipation (stool softeners)
- Gradual return to activity

**Follow-Up**:
- 2 weeks: Assess healing, remove vaginal packing if used
- 6 weeks: Resume activity, assess healing
- 3-6 months: Assess symptomatic and anatomic success
- Long-term: Annual examinations

**Pelvic Floor Physical Therapy**:
- Postoperative pelvic floor PT may enhance outcomes
- Teach proper lifting, bowel habits

### Recurrent Prolapse

**Incidence**: 30% at 5 years overall

**Risk Factors**:
- Obesity
- Chronic straining
- Tissue quality (connective tissue disorders)
- Inadequate initial repair
- Incomplete apical support

**Management**:
- Conservative: Pessary, pelvic floor PT
- Surgical:
  - Different approach than initial surgery
  - Abdominal sacral colpopexy if prior vaginal repair failed
  - Address all compartments
  - Consider mesh augmentation (informed consent)

## Fecal Incontinence and Anal Sphincter Disorders

### Overview
- Loss of voluntary bowel control
- Affects 2-10% of women (underreported)
- Significant impact on quality of life

### Etiology
- **Obstetric trauma**: Sphincter injury during childbirth (most common)
- **Neurological**: Pudendal neuropathy, spinal cord injury
- **Anorectal disease**: Hemorrhoids, fistulas, inflammatory bowel disease
- **Iatrogenic**: Anal sphincter surgery

### Diagnosis

**History**:
- Stool consistency, frequency of incontinence
- Urgency, passive leakage
- Impact on quality of life (validated questionnaires)

**Examination**:
- **Inspection**: Scarring, fistulas, rectocele
- **Digital rectal exam**: Assess sphincter tone, defects
- **Anoscopy/sigmoidoscopy**: Rule out anorectal pathology

**Imaging/Testing**:
- **Endoanal ultrasound**: Identify sphincter defects
- **Anorectal manometry**: Assess sphincter pressures
- **Defecography**: Assess pelvic floor dynamics

### Conservative Management

**Dietary Modifications**:
- Bulk-forming agents (fiber)
- Avoid trigger foods (caffeine, alcohol)

**Biofeedback and Pelvic Floor PT**:
- Strengthen external anal sphincter
- Improve rectal sensation
- Success: 50-70%

**Medications**:
- **Loperamide**: Decrease stool frequency, firm stool
- **Cholestyramine**: Bile acid diarrhea

### Surgical Management

#### Sphincteroplasty (Overlapping Sphincter Repair)

**Indications**:
- External anal sphincter defect
- Failed conservative management

**Technique**:
1. **Perianal incision**: Curved incision
2. **Identify sphincter ends**: Dissect scar tissue
3. **Overlap repair**: Overlap sphincter ends (mattress sutures)
4. **Internal sphincter repair**: If defect identified
5. **Closure**

**Outcomes**:
- **Initial success**: 70-80%
- **Long-term success**: 50-60% at 5 years (deterioration over time)

**Complications**:
- Infection, wound breakdown
- Recurrent incontinence
- Dyspareunia

#### Sacral Neuromodulation (InterStim)

**Indications**:
- Fecal incontinence refractory to conservative management
- Intact or surgically repaired sphincter

**Technique**:
- **Stage 1**: Temporary lead placement (S3 nerve root), test stimulation
- **Stage 2**: Permanent generator implant (if >50% improvement)

**Outcomes**:
- 70-80% success rate in responders

#### Injectable Bulking Agents

- Perianal injection of bulking materials
- Modest success (40-60%)
- Temporary improvement

#### Artificial Bowel Sphincter

- Rarely performed
- Inflatable cuff around anal canal
- High complication rates (infection, erosion, mechanical failure)

#### Colostomy

- Last resort for severe, refractory fecal incontinence
- Permanent fecal diversion
- Improves quality of life when all else fails
