# Minimally Invasive Gynecology

## Overview

Minimally invasive gynecologic surgery has revolutionized the field, offering reduced postoperative pain, faster recovery, shorter hospital stays, and improved cosmesis compared to traditional laparotomy. Techniques include laparoscopy (conventional and advanced), robotic-assisted surgery, hysteroscopy, and vaginal surgery. These approaches are now standard for many gynecologic procedures, from benign conditions to oncologic surgery. Success requires mastery of specialized techniques, appropriate patient selection, and recognition of when conversion to laparotomy is necessary.

## Laparoscopic Surgery

### Principles and Equipment

**Basic Equipment**:
- **Laparoscope**: 5mm or 10mm, 0° or 30° angled
- **Trocars**: 5mm and 10-12mm ports
- **Insufflator**: CO2 pneumoperitoneum (12-15 mmHg)
- **Light source and camera**: High-definition visualization
- **Energy devices**: Monopolar, bipolar, ultrasonic, advanced bipolar
- **Instrumentation**: Graspers, scissors, needle holders, suction-irrigator

**Advantages**:
- Magnified visualization
- Reduced blood loss
- Less postoperative pain
- Faster recovery (return to normal activity 1-2 weeks vs. 4-6 weeks open)
- Shorter hospital stay (same-day or 23-hour vs. 2-5 days)
- Reduced adhesion formation
- Improved cosmesis (small incisions)

**Disadvantages**:
- Loss of tactile feedback
- Two-dimensional vision (3D available with some systems)
- Limited range of motion
- Learning curve
- Longer operative time (initially)
- Equipment costs
- Risk of trocar injury

### Patient Positioning and Access

**Positioning**:
- Supine with arms tucked
- Dorsal lithotomy for gynecologic procedures
- **Trendelenburg** (steep, 25-30°): Displace bowel from pelvis
- Padded well to prevent nerve injury

**Access Techniques**:

**Veress Needle**:
- Blind insertion at umbilicus or Palmer's point (left upper quadrant)
- Create pneumoperitoneum before trocar insertion
- **Safety tests**: Saline drop test, pressure <10 mmHg initially, absence of blood/bowel contents
- **Advantages**: Quick, minimally invasive
- **Disadvantages**: Blind entry, risk of injury

**Open Entry (Hasson Technique)**:
- Cutdown to fascia, direct visualization
- Blunt trocar insertion
- **Indications**: Prior surgery, obesity, pregnancy, thin patient
- **Advantages**: Safest entry, visualize layers
- **Disadvantages**: Larger umbilical incision

**Optical Trocar**:
- Visualize layers as trocar advanced
- Intermediate between Veress and open

**Direct Trocar Entry**:
- No prior pneumoperitoneum
- Experienced surgeons only

### Port Placement

**Standard Configuration** (Gynecologic):
- **Umbilical**: 10-12mm camera port
- **Bilateral lower quadrants**: 5mm working ports (lateral to inferior epigastric vessels)
- **Suprapubic**: Optional 5mm or 10-12mm port
- Triangulation: Instruments approach target from different angles

**Avoiding Vascular Injury**:
- **Inferior epigastric vessels**: Transilluminate or visualize before lateral port placement
- **Great vessels**: Midline entry (aortic bifurcation at L4-L5, below umbilicus)
- **Iliac vessels**: Avoid deep trocar insertion at pelvic sidewall

### Laparoscopic Hysterectomy

**Types**:
- **Laparoscopic-Assisted Vaginal Hysterectomy (LAVH)**: Laparoscopy to ligate upper pedicles, complete vaginally
- **Total Laparoscopic Hysterectomy (TLH)**: Entire procedure laparoscopic, including vaginal cuff closure
- **Supracervical Laparoscopic Hysterectomy (LSH)**: Remove uterine corpus, preserve cervix

**Indications**:
- Benign uterine disease (fibroids, abnormal bleeding, endometriosis)
- Early endometrial cancer
- Cervical dysplasia (in situ disease)
- Desire for minimally invasive approach

**Technique** (Total Laparoscopic Hysterectomy):
1. **Port placement**: Umbilical camera, bilateral ports, ± suprapubic
2. **Survey pelvis**: Assess pathology, adhesions
3. **Manipulator placement**: Uterine manipulator (vaginal) for anteversion
4. **Round ligament division**: Bipolar and cut bilaterally
5. **Bladder flap**: Develop vesicouterine space, mobilize bladder inferiorly
6. **Utero-ovarian/infundibulopelvic ligament**:
   - Preserve ovaries: Divide utero-ovarian ligament and fallopian tube
   - Remove ovaries: Divide infundibulopelvic ligament (identify ureter first)
7. **Uterine artery ligation**: Skeletonize, bipolar, and cut at level of internal os
8. **Cardinal ligament division**: Sequential ligation and division
9. **Colpotomy**: Circumferential incision around cervix (monopolar or ultrasonic)
10. **Specimen removal**: Through vagina (may require morcellation if large)
11. **Vaginal cuff closure**: Laparoscopic or vaginal approach
12. **Inspect pelvis**: Hemostasis, irrigation

**Morcellation**:
- **Power morcellation**: FDA warning (2014) due to dissemination of occult malignancy
- **Contained morcellation**: Use of bag to contain tissue during morcellation (reduces but doesn't eliminate risk)
- **Manual morcellation**: Scalpel sectioning of specimen (safer but time-consuming)
- **Avoid if cancer possible**: Postmenopausal bleeding, rapidly enlarging mass

**Postoperative Care**:
- Same-day or 23-hour discharge
- Resume activity 1-2 weeks
- Pelvic rest 4-6 weeks
- Pain management (NSAIDs, short-term opioids)

**Outcomes**:
- Equivalent to abdominal hysterectomy for oncologic and benign outcomes
- Faster recovery, less pain, shorter stay vs. open
- Operative time longer than vaginal but shorter than open (surgeon-dependent)

**Complications**:
- **Bladder injury** (1-2%): Higher than vaginal, similar to abdominal
- **Ureteral injury** (0.5-1%): Thermal or transection
- **Vascular injury** (0.1-0.5%): Trocar, uterine artery
- **Bowel injury** (0.5%): Entry or intraoperative
- **Conversion to laparotomy** (2-5%): Bleeding, adhesions, difficult anatomy
- **Vaginal cuff dehiscence** (1-2%): Higher than vaginal/abdominal (unclear why)

### Laparoscopic Myomectomy

(See benign gynecologic conditions for details)

**Technique**:
- Inject vasopressin to reduce bleeding
- Incise over fibroid, enucleate
- Multilayer closure
- Contained morcellation for specimen removal

**Challenges**:
- Laparoscopic suturing required (robotic easier)
- Bleeding control
- Large or multiple fibroids difficult

### Laparoscopic Adnexal Surgery

**Ovarian Cystectomy**:
- Incise ovarian cortex
- Enucleate cyst (stripping technique)
- Hemostasis (minimize ovarian damage)
- Remove specimen intact if possible (bag if concerned for malignancy)

**Oophorectomy/Salpingo-Oophorectomy**:
- Identify ureter
- Divide infundibulopelvic ligament (ligate ovarian vessels)
- If preserving uterus: divide utero-ovarian ligament instead
- Remove through port or vagina

**Tubal Ectopic Pregnancy**:
- **Salpingectomy**: Remove tube (preferred, reduces future ectopic risk)
- **Salpingostomy**: Incise tube, remove products, leave tube (higher recurrence, persistent trophoblast)

### Advanced Laparoscopic Procedures

**Laparoscopic Sacral Colpopexy**:
- (See pelvic floor disorders section)
- Technically demanding
- Requires suturing skills

**Deep Infiltrating Endometriosis Excision**:
- Resect rectovaginal endometriosis
- May require bowel resection, ureterolysis
- Multidisciplinary (colorectal surgery involvement)

**Laparoscopic Lymphadenectomy**:
- Pelvic and/or para-aortic nodes
- Oncologic procedures (endometrial, cervical cancer)
- Identify anatomic landmarks, vessels
- Clip or seal lymphatics

### Energy Sources in Laparoscopy

**Monopolar Electrosurgery**:
- Current passes through patient to grounding pad
- **Modes**: Cutting (continuous waveform), coagulation (interrupted waveform), blend
- **Risks**: Capacitive coupling, direct coupling, stray current
- **Caution**: Lateral thermal spread, bowel injury

**Bipolar Electrosurgery**:
- Current flows between two poles of instrument
- Safer than monopolar (no grounding pad, less stray current)
- Effective for vessel sealing

**Advanced Bipolar Devices** (LigaSure, Enseal):
- Seal vessels up to 7mm
- Minimal lateral thermal spread (2mm)
- Faster than individual ligation

**Ultrasonic Energy** (Harmonic Scalpel):
- Ultrasonic vibration denatures proteins, coagulates vessels
- Minimal lateral spread (1mm)
- No electrical current (safer near nerves, pacemakers)
- Slower than advanced bipolar

## Robotic Surgery

### Overview
- Master-slave system (surgeon console controls robotic arms)
- **da Vinci Surgical System**: Most widely used
- Enhances surgeon capabilities (3D visualization, articulating instruments, tremor filtration)

### Advantages Over Traditional Laparoscopy
- **3D high-definition vision**: Depth perception
- **Articulating instruments (EndoWrist)**: 7 degrees of freedom (wrist-like movements)
- **Tremor filtration**: Smooth, precise movements
- **Ergonomics**: Surgeon sits at console
- **Facilitates complex suturing**: Easier to learn intracorporeal suturing

### Disadvantages
- **Cost**: Equipment, disposables, maintenance
- **Lack of tactile feedback**: Rely on visual cues
- **Larger trocars**: 8mm minimum
- **Longer setup time**: Docking robot
- **Limited access**: Once docked, difficult to change port positions
- **Learning curve**: Different from traditional laparoscopy

### Applications in Gynecology

**Hysterectomy**:
- Most common robotic gynecologic procedure
- Facilitates suturing (vaginal cuff closure)
- Similar outcomes to laparoscopic, faster recovery than open

**Myomectomy**:
- Ideal for robotic approach (requires extensive suturing)
- Easier to perform multilayer closure than laparoscopy
- Improved uterine reconstruction

**Sacral Colpopexy**:
- Excellent application (suturing, confined space)
- Equivalent outcomes to laparoscopic, may be easier to learn

**Endometriosis Excision**:
- Facilitates deep dissection
- Suturing bowel if resected

**Oncologic Surgery**:
- Endometrial cancer staging (hysterectomy, lymphadenectomy)
- Cervical cancer (radical hysterectomy) - NOTE: Recent data suggests open may be superior for cervical cancer
- Ovarian cancer debulking (selected cases)

### Technique Considerations

**Port Placement**:
- **Robotic ports**: 8mm (usually 3 robotic arms)
- **Camera port**: 12mm
- **Assistant port**: 10-12mm (suction, retraction, specimen removal)
- **Configuration**: Wider spacing than laparoscopy (avoid arm collision)

**Docking**:
- Position robot (side docking or between legs)
- Attach arms to ports
- Test all instruments before scrubbing out

**Console Surgeon**:
- Sits away from patient at console
- Controls camera and instruments
- Assistant at bedside essential (suction, specimen extraction, instrument exchange)

### Robotic vs. Laparoscopic vs. Open

**Oncologic Outcomes**:
- **Endometrial cancer**: Equivalent survival, improved recovery vs. open
- **Cervical cancer**: Laparoscopic/robotic may have worse survival than open (LACC trial), use caution

**Cost**:
- Robotic most expensive
- May offset by shorter stay, faster return to work

**Recovery**:
- Robotic and laparoscopic similar
- Both superior to open

**Operative Time**:
- Robotic longer than laparoscopic initially (learning curve, docking)
- Experienced surgeons: Similar times

## Hysteroscopy

### Overview
- Endoscopic visualization of uterine cavity
- Diagnostic and operative procedures
- Office-based or operating room

### Equipment

**Hysteroscope**:
- **Diagnostic**: Small diameter (3-5mm), no operating channel
- **Operative**: Larger (5-10mm), with operating channel

**Distension Media**:
- **Low-viscosity fluids**: Normal saline, lactated Ringer's (bipolar electrosurgery)
- **High-viscosity fluids**: Glycine, sorbitol (monopolar electrosurgery) - risk of hyponatremia
- **CO2 gas**: Diagnostic only

**Energy Sources**:
- **Mechanical**: Scissors, graspers, morcellators
- **Monopolar electrosurgery**: Resectoscope (glycine distension)
- **Bipolar electrosurgery**: Saline distension (safer, no hyponatremia risk)
- **Laser**: Nd:YAG, holmium

### Diagnostic Hysteroscopy

**Indications**:
- Abnormal uterine bleeding
- Postmenopausal bleeding
- Suspected intrauterine pathology (polyps, fibroids, adhesions)
- Infertility evaluation
- Abnormal imaging (thickened endometrium, filling defect)
- Recurrent pregnancy loss

**Technique**:
- Office-based (vaginoscopic approach, no speculum/tenaculum)
- Cervical dilation minimal or none (small-diameter scopes)
- Systematic inspection: Anterior, posterior, lateral walls, tubal ostia, endometrium
- Target biopsy if lesions identified

**Findings**:
- Endometrial polyps
- Submucosal fibroids
- Intrauterine adhesions (Asherman's syndrome)
- Uterine septum or anomalies
- Endometrial hyperplasia/cancer
- Foreign bodies (retained IUD fragments, bone)

### Operative Hysteroscopy

**Polypectomy**:
- Grasp and twist off polyp
- Electrosurgical resection at base
- Hysteroscopic morcellator (MyoSure)

**Myomectomy** (Submucosal Fibroids):
- **Type 0** (pedunculated): Resect at base
- **Type 1** (<50% intramural): Resect visible portion, may need staged procedure
- **Type 2** (>50% intramural): Difficult, consider abdominal myomectomy
- **Technique**: Resectoscope to shave fibroid in strips, or hysteroscopic morcellator

**Endometrial Ablation**:
- (See abnormal uterine bleeding section)
- Destroy endometrium to reduce/eliminate menstrual bleeding

**Adhesiolysis** (Asherman's Syndrome):
- Lyse intrauterine adhesions
- Scissors or electrosurgery
- Postoperative estrogen therapy to promote healing
- Consider IUD placement to prevent re-adhesion

**Septum Resection**:
- Congenital uterine septum (associated with recurrent pregnancy loss)
- Resect septum with scissors or electrosurgery
- Restore normal uterine cavity

**Foreign Body Removal**:
- Remove retained IUD fragments, embedded IUD, fetal bone

### Complications

**Fluid Overload**:
- Absorption of hypotonic distension media (glycine)
- **Hyponatremia**: Confusion, seizures, coma
- **Prevention**: Monitor fluid deficit (<1000-1500mL), limit operative time
- **Treatment**: Diuretics, hypertonic saline if severe

**Uterine Perforation** (1-2%):
- Risk higher with stenotic cervix, postmenopausal, extensive pathology
- **Recognition**: Loss of distension, visual entry into peritoneum, bowel/omentum visible
- **Management**:
  - Mechanical perforation: Observation (if small, no bleeding)
  - Electrosurgical perforation: Laparoscopy to assess injury (risk of bowel thermal injury)
  - Vascular/bowel injury: Laparoscopy or laparotomy for repair

**Bleeding**:
- Usually minor
- Balloon tamponade if significant
- Rarely requires transfusion or hysterectomy

**Infection** (<1%):
- Endometritis
- Antibiotics

**Adhesions**:
- Can occur after aggressive resection
- Prevention: Postoperative estrogen, IUD

**Gas Embolism** (CO2 distension):
- Rare but potentially fatal
- Avoid CO2 for operative procedures

## Vaginal Surgery

### Overview
- Natural orifice surgery (no abdominal incisions)
- **Vaginal hysterectomy**: Gold standard for uterine descent, no abdominal pathology
- Lower morbidity than abdominal
- Faster recovery
- Requires specific anatomy (mobile uterus, adequate vaginal caliber, no significant adhesions)

### Vaginal Hysterectomy

**Indications**:
- Uterine prolapse
- Benign uterine disease (fibroids, abnormal bleeding) with favorable anatomy
- No significant adnexal pathology requiring visualization

**Contraindications** (Relative):
- Large uterus (>12-14 weeks size)
- Endometriosis, adhesions
- Adnexal pathology requiring inspection
- Nulliparity with small vagina

**Technique**:
1. **Posterior colpotomy**: Incise posterior vaginal fornix, enter posterior cul-de-sac
2. **Uterosacral/cardinal ligament ligation**: Clamp, cut, ligate bilaterally
3. **Anterior colpotomy**: Develop vesicouterine space, enter anterior peritoneum
4. **Uterine artery ligation**: Clamp, cut, ligate bilaterally
5. **Utero-ovarian ligament ligation** (if preserving ovaries): Clamp, cut, ligate
   - Or infundibulopelvic ligament if removing ovaries
6. **Specimen delivery**: Remove uterus through vagina
7. **Inspect adnexa** (if peritoneum entered): Visualize tubes/ovaries, remove if planned
8. **Peritoneal closure**: Close anterior and posterior peritoneum
9. **Vaginal cuff closure**: Incorporate uterosacral ligaments for support
10. **Hemostasis**: Ensure no bleeding

**McCall Culdoplasty**:
- Plication of uterosacral ligaments to obliterate cul-de-sac
- Prevents future enterocele
- Provides apical support

**Outcomes**:
- Faster recovery than abdominal
- Less pain
- Shorter hospital stay
- Lower cost
- Equivalent to laparoscopic/robotic for uncomplicated cases

**Complications**:
- **Bleeding** (1-2%): May require transfusion, re-exploration
- **Bladder injury** (1-2%)
- **Ureteral injury** (<1%)
- **Bowel injury** (<1%)
- **Infection** (5-10%): Cuff cellulitis, abscess
- **Vaginal cuff dehiscence** (<1%)

### Vaginal Prolapse Repairs

(See pelvic floor disorders section)
- Anterior colporrhaphy
- Posterior colporrhaphy
- Uterosacral ligament suspension
- Sacrospinous ligament fixation

## Single-Site and Reduced-Port Surgery

**Single-Incision Laparoscopic Surgery (SILS)**:
- All instruments through single umbilical incision
- Improved cosmesis (hidden scar)
- **Challenges**: Instrument collision, limited triangulation
- **Applications**: Hysterectomy, adnexal surgery, myomectomy

**Reduced-Port Laparoscopy**:
- Fewer ports than traditional (2-3 instead of 4)
- Balance cosmesis with functionality

**Outcomes**:
- Similar to multiport laparoscopy
- Longer operative time
- Not widely adopted (marginal benefit)

## Natural Orifice Transluminal Endoscopic Surgery (NOTES)

- Access peritoneum via natural orifice (vagina, rectum)
- **Transvaginal NOTES**: Culdotomy for peritoneal access
- Experimental, not widely adopted
- Potential for scarless surgery
