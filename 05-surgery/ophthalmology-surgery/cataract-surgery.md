# Cataract Surgery

## Overview

Cataract surgery is the most commonly performed surgical procedure worldwide, with over 3 million cases annually in the United States alone. A cataract is opacification of the crystalline lens, resulting in progressive vision loss. Modern cataract surgery involves phacoemulsification (ultrasonic fragmentation) of the lens nucleus followed by intraocular lens (IOL) implantation. This outpatient procedure boasts excellent success rates (>95% improve vision) with low complication rates. Advances in surgical technique, IOL technology, and biometry have transformed cataract surgery from a vision-restoring procedure to a refractive procedure capable of correcting pre-existing refractive errors.

## Lens Anatomy and Physiology

### Normal Lens

**Structure**:
- **Capsule**: Transparent elastic basement membrane (anterior and posterior)
  - Anterior capsule: Thicker (10-15 μm)
  - Posterior capsule: Thinner (2-4 μm), more fragile
- **Epithelium**: Single layer of cells on anterior capsule (dividing cells migrate to equator, differentiate into lens fibers)
- **Cortex**: Outer lens fibers (less dense)
- **Nucleus**: Central dense lens fibers (formed in utero and early life)

**Function**:
- **Refraction**: Provides ~20 diopters (D) of eye's total 60D refractive power
- **Accommodation**: Change shape to focus near objects (decreases with age - presbyopia)
- **Clarity**: Transparent (proteins arranged in crystalline pattern)

**Size**:
- Diameter: ~9mm
- Thickness: 3.5-5mm (increases throughout life)

**Zonules**: Suspensory ligaments attach lens equator to ciliary body (hold lens in position)

## Cataract Pathophysiology

### Definition

Progressive opacification of the crystalline lens, resulting in light scattering and reduced visual acuity.

### Classification by Location

**Nuclear Sclerotic Cataract** (most common in elderly):
- Central nucleus hardens and yellows/browns
- **Symptoms**: Decreased distance vision, glare, myopic shift (can temporarily improve near vision - "second sight")
- **Progression**: Slow, years

**Cortical Cataract**:
- Spoke-like opacities in lens cortex radiating from periphery
- **Symptoms**: Glare (especially with bright lights), monocular diplopia
- **Progression**: Variable

**Posterior Subcapsular Cataract (PSC)**:
- Opacity on posterior lens capsule
- **Symptoms**: Glare, decreased vision in bright light (pupil constricts, light passes through central opacity), difficulty reading
- **Risk factors**: Steroids, diabetes, UV radiation, younger patients
- **Progression**: Can be rapid (months)

**Mixed**: Combination of above types (common)

### Etiology

**Age-related** (most common):
- Oxidative stress, protein aggregation, decreased antioxidant defenses
- Risk increases with age (50% by age 75, 70% by age 85)

**Congenital**:
- Maternal infections (TORCH: Toxoplasmosis, Rubella, CMV, HSV)
- Metabolic (galactosemia)
- Genetic syndromes (Down syndrome)

**Secondary**:
- **Diabetes**: Osmotic stress (sorbitol accumulation), glycation
- **Medications**: Steroids (PSC), amiodarone, chlorpromazine
- **Ocular disease**: Uveitis, high myopia, retinitis pigmentosa
- **Trauma**: Blunt injury, penetrating injury, electric shock, radiation

**Traumatic**:
- Blunt trauma (contusion cataract, Vossius ring)
- Penetrating injury (immediate or delayed)
- Radiation (ionizing, UV)

### Grading

**LOCS III (Lens Opacities Classification System III)**:
- Nuclear opalescence (NO): 0.1-6.9
- Nuclear color (NC): 0.1-6.9
- Cortical (C): 0.1-5.9
- Posterior subcapsular (P): 0.1-5.9

## Clinical Presentation and Diagnosis

### Symptoms

- **Blurred vision**: Progressive, painless
- **Glare and halos**: Especially night driving (oncoming headlights)
- **Decreased contrast sensitivity**: Difficulty in dim lighting
- **Frequent eyeglass prescription changes**
- **Monocular diplopia**: Double vision in one eye (cortical cataract)
- **Faded colors**: Advanced cataracts

### Examination

**Visual Acuity**:
- Snellen chart (distance)
- Near vision card
- Potential Acuity Meter (PAM) or laser interferometry: Predict post-operative vision if retinal pathology suspected

**Slit Lamp Examination**:
- Detailed lens examination (location, density, type of opacity)
- Assess anterior chamber (shallow chamber - angle closure risk during surgery)
- Corneal clarity, endothelial health (specular microscopy if Fuchs' dystrophy suspected)

**Dilated Fundus Examination**:
- Rule out retinal pathology (macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy) that may limit visual improvement post-surgery
- Assess red reflex (dense cataract impairs view)

**Intraocular Pressure**: Rule out glaucoma (coexisting disease common)

**Pupil Dilation**: Assess pupil size, dilate poorly (small pupil increases surgical difficulty)

### Indications for Surgery

**Functional Visual Impairment**:
- Vision loss interfering with daily activities (reading, driving, hobbies)
- No specific visual acuity threshold (patient-centered decision)
- Generally considered when vision 20/40 or worse with glare symptoms

**Medical Indications** (regardless of symptoms):
- **Lens-induced inflammation**: Phacolytic glaucoma, phacoantigenic uveitis
- **Angle closure glaucoma**: Lens intumescence causing pupillary block
- **Inability to visualize fundus**: Prevents management of diabetic retinopathy, macular degeneration
- **Visually significant anisometropia**: Significant refractive difference between eyes

**No Surgery** if:
- Patient satisfied with vision
- Vision loss not from cataract (retinal disease limiting potential)
- Medical contraindications (uncontrolled glaucoma, active uveitis, unrealistic expectations)

## Preoperative Assessment

### Biometry

**Purpose**: Measure axial length and corneal power to calculate IOL power

**A-Scan Ultrasound** (older method):
- Contact or immersion technique
- Measures axial length
- Less accurate (especially post-refractive surgery)

**Optical Biometry** (IOLMaster, Lenstar - current standard):
- Non-contact, laser interferometry
- Measures: Axial length, anterior chamber depth, corneal curvature (keratometry), lens thickness
- **Advantages**: More accurate, reproducible, no corneal contact
- **Limitations**: Cannot measure through dense cataracts (revert to ultrasound)

**Keratometry**:
- Measures corneal curvature (anterior surface power)
- Manual keratometer or automated (IOLMaster, topography)

### IOL Power Calculation

**Formulas**: Use axial length, keratometry, anterior chamber depth to calculate IOL power

**Third-Generation Formulas**:
- **SRK/T**: Long and short eyes
- **Holladay 1, Hoffer Q**: Variable accuracy based on axial length

**Fourth-Generation Formulas** (current standard):
- **Haigis**: Uses anterior chamber depth, lens thickness
- **Holladay 2**: Multiple parameters
- Better accuracy, especially extreme axial lengths

**Fifth-Generation Formulas** (newest):
- **Barrett Universal II**: Excellent accuracy across all axial lengths
- **Hill-RBF**: Artificial intelligence-based

**Special Situations**:
- **Post-refractive surgery**: Challenging (altered corneal curvature measurements)
  - Use corneal topography, intraoperative aberrometry
- **High myopia/hyperopia**: Formulas less accurate at extremes

**Target Refraction**:
- **Emmetropia** (0D): Distance vision without glasses (most common goal)
- **Monovision**: One eye for distance, one for near (presbyopia compensation)
- **Mild myopia**: Near vision without glasses (reading)

### Medical Optimization

**Optimize Ocular Surface**:
- Treat dry eye (artificial tears, punctal plugs)
- Control blepharitis, meibomian gland dysfunction
- Improves surgical view, reduces infection risk, enhances biometry accuracy

**Control Inflammation**:
- Active uveitis contraindication (delay surgery, control with steroids/immunosuppression)

**Manage Comorbidities**:
- **Diabetes**: Optimize glycemic control (reduce infection risk, diabetic macular edema)
- **Alpha-1 antagonists** (tamsulosin for BPH): Risk of intraoperative floppy iris syndrome (IFIS)
  - Consider discontinuing or alert surgeon

**Anticoagulation**: Generally continue (low bleeding risk)

### Consent

**Risks**:
- **Common**: Temporary blurred vision, red eye, photophobia, floaters
- **Serious**: Infection (endophthalmitis 0.05-0.1%), retinal detachment (0.5-1%), corneal edema, cystoid macular edema (1-2%), posterior capsular opacification (PCO), refractive surprise, vision loss (rare)

**Benefits**: Improved vision, reduced glare, enhanced quality of life

## Surgical Technique: Phacoemulsification

### Anesthesia

**Topical**: Most common
- Anesthetic drops (tetracaine, lidocaine)
- **Advantages**: No injection, faster recovery, fewer complications
- Requires patient cooperation

**Intracameral**: Lidocaine injected into anterior chamber (supplement topical)

**Regional**:
- **Peribulbar block**: Injection around orbit (not into muscle cone)
- **Retrobulbar block**: Injection into muscle cone (deeper, more complete anesthesia/akinesia)
- **Indications**: Anxious patients, lengthy procedures, combined procedures
- **Risks**: Retrobulbar hemorrhage, globe perforation, optic nerve injury

**General**: Pediatric, uncooperative patients

### Surgical Steps

**1. Incision**:
- **Clear corneal incision**: Most common, temporal or superior
  - 2.2-2.8mm width (small incision, self-sealing, minimal astigmatism)
  - Multi-plane (valved) for self-sealing
- **Scleral tunnel**: Alternative, larger incisions
- **Paracentesis**: 1-2 side-port incisions (1mm) for instrument access, chamber stability

**2. Viscoelastic Injection**:
- Inject ophthalmic viscosurgical device (OVD) into anterior chamber
- **Purpose**: Maintain chamber depth, protect corneal endothelium, stabilize capsule
- **Types**: Cohesive (Healon) vs. dispersive (Viscoat)

**3. Capsulorrhexis**:
- **Continuous curvilinear capsulorrhexis (CCC)**: Circular opening in anterior capsule
- **Technique**: Cystotome or forceps, tear capsule in circular fashion (5-6mm diameter)
- **Goal**: Complete, centered, appropriately sized (cover IOL optic edge)
- **Importance**: Incomplete tear can extend to periphery during surgery (capsular tear, vitreous loss)

**4. Hydrodissection**:
- Inject balanced salt solution (BSS) under capsule, separating cortex from capsule
- Allows lens rotation within capsular bag

**5. Phacoemulsification**:
- **Ultrasound probe** inserted through main incision
- **Technique**: Divide nucleus into fragments, emulsify with ultrasound, aspirate
  - **Divide and conquer**: Sculpt grooves, crack nucleus into quadrants
  - **Phaco chop**: Chopper instrument to fracture nucleus (faster, less ultrasound energy)
- **Energy**: Minimize ultrasound time/energy (reduces endothelial damage, corneal edema)

**6. Irrigation/Aspiration (I/A)**:
- Remove residual cortical material
- Bimanual I/A handpiece (irrigates and aspirates)
- **Polish posterior capsule**: Remove epithelial cells (reduce PCO risk)

**7. IOL Insertion**:
- **Injector system**: Insert folded IOL through small incision
- **Placement**: Position in capsular bag (preferred - stable, predictable refraction)
  - Alternative: Sulcus placement (if capsular tear, adjust IOL power)
- **Unfold and center IOL**: Ensure haptics (supporting arms) in capsular bag

**8. Viscoelastic Removal**:
- Irrigate/aspirate OVD (prevents postoperative pressure spike)

**9. Wound Hydration**:
- Inject BSS into corneal stroma at wound edges (seals incision, increases hydrostatic resistance)

**10. Verify Wound Closure**:
- Test for leakage (Seidel test with fluorescein)
- Suture if needed (rare with modern small incisions)

### Intraocular Lens (IOL) Selection

**Monofocal IOL** (standard):
- Single focal point (distance or near)
- Excellent distance vision, need reading glasses
- Covered by insurance

**Toric IOL**:
- Corrects astigmatism (>1.0-1.5D)
- Aligned to steep corneal meridian
- Rotational stability critical

**Multifocal IOL**:
- Multiple focal points (distance and near)
- **Goal**: Spectacle independence
- **Disadvantages**: Halos, glare, reduced contrast sensitivity
- **Contraindications**: Macular disease, high expectations
- Premium cost (patient pays difference)

**Extended Depth of Focus (EDOF)**:
- Elongates focal point (distance and intermediate)
- Less halos than multifocal
- Premium cost

**Accommodating IOL**:
- Designed to move/change shape for accommodation
- Limited clinical success

**Light-Adjustable Lens (LAL)**:
- Adjusted post-operatively with UV light (fine-tune refraction)
- Premium cost, requires compliance with UV treatments

### Intraoperative Complications

**Posterior Capsular Rupture (PCR)** (2-5%):
- **Cause**: Excessive manipulation, weak capsule, surgical error
- **Significance**: Vitreous loss (requires vitrectomy), zonular damage, affects IOL placement
- **Management**:
  - Stop immediately when recognized
  - Anterior vitrectomy (vitrector to remove prolapsed vitreous)
  - IOL: Sulcus placement (if adequate capsular support) or anterior chamber IOL
- **Complications**: Increased risk of retinal detachment, cystoid macular edema, endophthalmitis

**Zonular Dialysis/Weakness**:
- **Causes**: Trauma, pseudoexfoliation, Marfan syndrome, high myopia
- **Management**: Capsular tension ring (CTR) to support capsule, iris hooks, consider sutured or AC IOL if severe

**Dropped Nucleus**:
- Nucleus fragments fall into vitreous (through PCR)
- **Management**: DO NOT chase into vitreous, refer to retina specialist for pars plana vitrectomy

**Suprachoroidal Hemorrhage**:
- RARE but devastating
- **Cause**: Rupture of choroidal vessel, sudden IOP drop
- **Presentation**: Pain, sudden shallowing of anterior chamber, dark choroidal mass
- **Management**: Close wounds immediately, medical management (cycloplegics, steroids, IOP control), drainage if persistent (days later)

**Corneal Burn**:
- Excessive phaco energy (ultrasound heat)
- **Prevention**: Adequate irrigation, minimize phaco time

## Postoperative Management

### Medications

**Topical Antibiotics**:
- **Fluoroquinolone** (moxifloxacin, gatifloxacin): 4 times daily for 1 week
- **Purpose**: Prevent endophthalmitis (though very rare)

**Topical Corticosteroids**:
- **Prednisolone acetate 1%**: 4 times daily, taper over 4 weeks
- **Purpose**: Reduce inflammation, prevent cystoid macular edema

**NSAIDs** (optional):
- **Ketorolac, nepafenac**: Reduce inflammation, CME risk (especially diabetics)
- Typically 3-4 times daily for 4 weeks

### Follow-Up

**Postoperative Day 1**:
- Visual acuity (usually improved, may be blurry from corneal edema)
- IOP (rule out pressure spike from retained viscoelastic)
- Slit lamp: Anterior chamber inflammation, wound integrity, IOL position

**1 Week**:
- Visual acuity improving
- Decreasing inflammation
- Assess for early complications

**1 Month**:
- Final refraction (prescribe glasses if needed)
- Evaluate for complications (CME, PCO)

**YAG Laser Capsulotomy** (if PCO develops):
- Typically months to years post-op

### Expected Visual Recovery

**Immediate (POD 1)**: Vision often improved but may be blurry (corneal edema)
**1 Week**: Continued improvement
**1 Month**: Final visual acuity reached (95% of eyes)
**Final Refraction**: 4-6 weeks (allow complete healing, refractive stabilization)

## Complications

### Early (Within Days)

**Endophthalmitis** (0.05-0.1%):
- **Cause**: Bacterial infection (Staph epidermidis, Staph aureus most common)
- **Presentation**: Pain, decreased vision, hypopyon (layered white cells in AC), vitreous haze
- **Timing**: Typically POD 2-7
- **Management**: Emergent intravitreal antibiotics (vancomycin + ceftazidime), vitreous tap/biopsy, consider vitrectomy if severe
- **Prognosis**: Variable, can result in severe vision loss

**Toxic Anterior Segment Syndrome (TASS)**:
- Sterile inflammation (vs. infectious endophthalmitis)
- **Cause**: Contaminants (detergents, endotoxins, preservatives) in irrigation solutions or instruments
- **Presentation**: Severe inflammation POD 1 (earlier than endophthalmitis), corneal edema, minimal pain
- **Management**: Topical steroids (high dose), usually resolves

**Elevated IOP**:
- **Cause**: Retained viscoelastic, steroid response, pre-existing glaucoma
- **Management**: Antiglaucoma drops, remove residual OVD if early

**Corneal Edema**:
- **Cause**: Endothelial damage (phaco energy, prolonged surgery)
- **Management**: Topical hypertonic saline (Muro 128), steroids, usually resolves
- **Persistent edema**: May need corneal transplant (DSEK, DMEK) if Fuchs' dystrophy or severe endothelial loss

**Wound Leak**:
- **Presentation**: Shallow anterior chamber, positive Seidel test
- **Management**: Pressure patch, aqueous suppressants; suture if persistent

### Late (Weeks to Months)

**Cystoid Macular Edema (CME)** (1-2%):
- **Irvine-Gass Syndrome**: Postoperative macular edema
- **Presentation**: Decreased vision 4-8 weeks post-op, macular thickening on OCT
- **Risk factors**: Diabetes, uveitis, posterior capsular rupture, prolonged surgery
- **Management**: Topical NSAIDs, steroids (topical or periocular injection); usually resolves in 3-6 months
- **Chronic CME**: May need intravitreal steroid or anti-VEGF

**Posterior Capsular Opacification (PCO)** (20-40% at 5 years):
- **"Secondary cataract"**: Proliferation of residual lens epithelial cells on posterior capsule
- **Presentation**: Gradual vision decrease, glare (months to years post-op)
- **Management**: **YAG laser posterior capsulotomy**
  - Outpatient, quick procedure
  - Laser creates opening in opacified capsule
  - **Risks**: Retinal detachment (1%), CME, IOP spike

**Retinal Detachment** (0.5-1%):
- **Risk factors**: High myopia, PCR during surgery, YAG capsulotomy
- **Presentation**: Flashes, floaters, visual field defect
- **Management**: Surgical repair (pars plana vitrectomy, scleral buckle)

**IOL Dislocation**:
- **Cause**: Zonular weakness, inadequate capsular support, trauma
- **Presentation**: Sudden vision change, IOL tilted or displaced
- **Management**: IOL repositioning, exchange, or sutured IOL

**Refractive Surprise**:
- Postoperative refraction significantly different from target
- **Causes**: Biometry errors, IOL calculation errors, IOL position, healing factors
- **Management**: Glasses, contact lenses, IOL exchange (if large error), secondary piggyback IOL, refractive surgery (LASIK/PRK)

### Chronic

**Chronic Uveitis**: Persistent inflammation (rule out infection, systemic causes)

**Glaucoma**: Secondary to inflammation, steroid response, retained lens material

## Outcomes

### Visual Outcomes

**Success Rate**: >95% of patients achieve improved vision
**Final Visual Acuity**:
- 85-90% achieve 20/40 or better (driving vision)
- 50-70% achieve 20/20 or better

**Limiting Factors**:
- Pre-existing retinal disease (AMD, diabetic retinopathy)
- Corneal disease (Fuchs' dystrophy, irregular astigmatism)
- Amblyopia
- Complications (endophthalmitis, CME, RD)

### Quality of Life

**Significant improvement** in:
- Visual function
- Independence (driving, reading)
- Fall risk reduction
- Overall quality of life

### Cost-Effectiveness

Highly cost-effective intervention (WHO priority)

## Special Considerations

### Pediatric Cataract

**Challenges**:
- **Amblyopia risk**: Critical period for visual development (age 0-8)
- **Inflammation**: More severe post-op
- **Secondary glaucoma**: Higher risk
- **IOL vs. Aphakia**: Controversy in infants (eye growth, refractive changes)

**Management**:
- Early surgery for visually significant cataracts (prevent amblyopia)
- Aggressive amblyopia treatment post-op (patching)
- Primary posterior capsulorrhexis + anterior vitrectomy (prevent PCO - high rate in children)

### Diabetic Patients

**Considerations**:
- **Diabetic retinopathy**: May worsen post-op
- **CME risk**: Higher
- **Preoperative**: Treat severe diabetic retinopathy before cataract surgery if possible

**Management**:
- Perioperative diabetic retinopathy assessment
- Prophylactic NSAIDs (reduce CME risk)
- Close follow-up

### Pseudoexfoliation Syndrome

**Characteristics**: White flaky material on lens, zonular weakness, small pupil
**Surgical challenges**: Zonular dialysis risk, capsular rupture, poor dilation
**Management**: Capsular tension ring, gentle technique, iris hooks/expanders

### Floppy Iris Syndrome (IFIS)

**Associated with**: Alpha-1 antagonists (tamsulosin for BPH)
**Features**: Iris billowing, progressive miosis, iris prolapse
**Management**: Intracameral epinephrine, iris hooks/expanders, lower fluidics settings

## Advances and Future Directions

**Femtosecond Laser-Assisted Cataract Surgery**:
- Laser creates incisions, capsulorrhexis, lens fragmentation
- More precise, reproducible
- Higher cost, debated benefit over manual technique

**Intraoperative Aberrometry**:
- Real-time refraction measurement during surgery
- Improves IOL power accuracy, especially toric alignment

**Premium IOLs**:
- Continuous improvement in multifocal, EDOF designs
- Better visual quality, fewer dysphotopsias

**Minimally Invasive Surgery**:
- Smaller incisions (<2mm)
- Faster recovery, less induced astigmatism

**Artificial Intelligence**:
- Improved biometry formulas (Hill-RBF)
- Surgical planning and guidance

## Key Points

- Cataract surgery most common ophthalmic procedure with >95% success rate for vision improvement
- Modern technique uses phacoemulsification (ultrasonic lens fragmentation) with small-incision surgery (2.2-2.8mm)
- Accurate biometry critical: optical biometry (IOLMaster) preferred; fourth/fifth-generation formulas (Barrett Universal II) most accurate
- Continuous curvilinear capsulorrhexis (CCC) essential step; incomplete tear can extend causing capsular rupture
- Posterior capsular rupture (PCR) most common intraoperative complication (2-5%); requires anterior vitrectomy, may affect IOL placement
- Postoperative regimen: Topical antibiotic + corticosteroid, taper over 4 weeks
- Endophthalmitis most feared complication (0.05-0.1%); presents POD 2-7 with pain, vision loss, hypopyon; emergent intravitreal antibiotics required
- Posterior capsular opacification (PCO) most common late complication (20-40% at 5 years); treated with YAG laser capsulotomy
- Cystoid macular edema (CME) causes vision loss 4-8 weeks post-op; higher risk in diabetics; treated with NSAIDs and steroids
- Premium IOLs (multifocal, toric, EDOF) can reduce spectacle dependence but have trade-offs (halos, glare, cost)
- Special populations require modified approach: pediatric (amblyopia risk), pseudoexfoliation (zonular weakness), IFIS (tamsulosin), diabetes (CME risk)
- Femtosecond laser-assisted surgery and intraoperative aberrometry represent technological advances improving precision and outcomes
