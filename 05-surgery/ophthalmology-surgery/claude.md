# Ophthalmology Surgery

## Overview

Ophthalmic surgery encompasses procedures to restore, preserve, or enhance vision and ocular function. This specialty has witnessed remarkable technological advances, with many procedures transitioning from open surgery to minimally invasive microsurgical techniques. Modern ophthalmic surgery emphasizes precision, minimal tissue trauma, and rapid visual rehabilitation. From cataract extraction to complex vitreoretinal procedures, ophthalmologic surgeons manage conditions affecting all structures of the eye.

**Content Status**: Comprehensive ophthalmologic surgical coverage

## Learning Objectives

- Master microsurgical techniques for intraocular surgery
- Understand indications and techniques for cataract extraction
- Learn filtration and shunt procedures for glaucoma management
- Apply vitreoretinal surgical principles for retinal pathology
- Recognize corneal transplantation indications and techniques
- Understand oculoplastic reconstructive procedures

## Key Points

- Ophthalmic surgery requires precise microsurgical technique and specialized instrumentation
- Cataract surgery most common ophthalmic procedure with excellent visual outcomes (>95% improve vision)
- Glaucoma surgery aims to lower intraocular pressure through filtration or drainage devices
- Vitreoretinal surgery addresses complex posterior segment pathology requiring 3-port vitrectomy
- Corneal transplantation techniques evolved to selective layer replacement (DSEK, DMEK) reducing rejection
- Oculoplastic surgery restores functional and cosmetic periorbital anatomy
