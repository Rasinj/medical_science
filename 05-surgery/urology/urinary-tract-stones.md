# Urinary Tract Stones (Nephrolithiasis and Ureterolithiasis)

## Overview

Urinary tract stones (urolithiasis) represent one of the most common urological conditions, affecting approximately 10% of the population during their lifetime. Kidney stones (nephrolithiasis) and ureteral stones (ureterolithiasis) can cause severe pain, urinary obstruction, infection, and renal impairment. Modern management emphasizes minimally invasive techniques including extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL), ureteroscopy (URS), and percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL).

### Epidemiology
- Lifetime prevalence: 8-10% in developed countries
- Male predominance (2-3:1 ratio)
- Peak incidence: 30-50 years of age
- Recurrence rate: 50% within 10 years
- Geographic variation ("stone belt" in southeastern United States)
- Increasing prevalence related to dietary factors and obesity

### Stone Composition
**Calcium-Based Stones (80%)**:
- Calcium oxalate (most common - 60%)
- Calcium phosphate (20%)
- Mixed calcium stones

**Non-Calcium Stones**:
- Uric acid (10%) - radiolucent
- Struvite/magnesium ammonium phosphate (10%) - infection stones
- Cystine (1-2%) - genetic disorder
- Drug-induced stones (rare)

### Risk Factors
- **Dietary**: High sodium, animal protein, oxalate; low calcium, fluid intake
- **Metabolic**: Hypercalciuria, hyperoxaluria, hypocitraturia, hyperuricosuria
- **Medical**: Gout, hyperparathyroidism, renal tubular acidosis, inflammatory bowel disease
- **Anatomic**: Horseshoe kidney, ureteropelvic junction obstruction, medullary sponge kidney
- **Medications**: Loop diuretics, calcium supplements, vitamin D, topiramate
- **Environmental**: Hot climate, occupational (pilots, truckers)

## Indications for Surgical Intervention

### Absolute Indications
- **Obstructed infected kidney**: Urosepsis with proximal obstruction (urological emergency)
- **Bilateral obstruction**: Acute kidney injury from bilateral stones or solitary kidney
- **Intractable pain**: Persistent severe pain despite medical management
- **Progressive renal deterioration**: Rising creatinine with obstruction

### Relative Indications
- **Stone size >10mm**: Low spontaneous passage rate
- **Failed medical expulsive therapy**: Stone not passing after 4-6 weeks
- **Patient occupation**: Pilots, air traffic controllers requiring stone clearance
- **Anatomic abnormalities**: Stones unlikely to pass spontaneously
- **Patient preference**: Desire for definitive treatment vs. observation
- **Staghorn calculi**: Risk of infection and renal damage
- **Solitary kidney**: Lower threshold for intervention

### Conservative Management (Observation)
- Small stones (<5mm): 80-90% spontaneous passage rate
- Distal ureteral location: Higher passage probability
- Adequate renal function: No obstruction or infection
- Tolerable pain: Managed with analgesics
- Patient compliance: Reliable follow-up

## Preoperative Assessment

### Clinical Evaluation
**History**:
- Pain characteristics (renal colic: severe, colicky flank pain radiating to groin)
- Hematuria (gross or microscopic)
- Previous stone episodes and treatments
- Dietary and fluid intake habits
- Medical history (gout, hyperparathyroidism, bowel disease)
- Family history of stones
- Medication review

**Physical Examination**:
- Costovertebral angle tenderness
- Abdominal examination (peritoneal signs, distension)
- Hydration status assessment
- Fever (suggests infection)
- Examination for other causes of abdominal pain

### Laboratory Studies
**Acute Setting**:
- Complete blood count (leukocytosis with infection)
- Comprehensive metabolic panel (creatinine, calcium, uric acid)
- Urinalysis and microscopy (hematuria, pyuria, crystals, pH)
- Urine culture if infection suspected
- Coagulation studies if intervention planned

**Metabolic Evaluation** (for recurrent stone formers):
- 24-hour urine collection (volume, calcium, oxalate, citrate, uric acid, sodium, creatinine)
- Serum: calcium, phosphorus, uric acid, PTH, vitamin D
- Stone analysis (if stone retrieved)
- Urine pH and specific gravity
- Cystine screening if family history or hexagonal crystals

### Imaging Studies

**Non-Contrast CT (Gold Standard)**:
- Sensitivity/specificity >95% for stone detection
- Determines size, location, density (Hounsfield units)
- Assesses degree of obstruction (hydronephrosis)
- Identifies anatomic abnormalities
- No oral or intravenous contrast needed
- Radiation exposure: 3-5 mSv (use low-dose protocols)

**Ultrasound**:
- First-line in pregnancy and children
- Detects hydronephrosis and proximal/distal stones
- Limited sensitivity for ureteral stones (45-60%)
- No radiation exposure
- Operator dependent

**Plain Radiography (KUB)**:
- Detects radiopaque stones (calcium-containing)
- Useful for tracking stone position
- Misses radiolucent stones (uric acid, cystine)
- Lower sensitivity than CT (45-60%)

**Intravenous Pyelography (IVP)**:
- Historical gold standard (largely replaced by CT)
- Provides functional and anatomic information
- Requires contrast administration
- Radiation exposure

### Preoperative Preparation
- NPO status (6-8 hours for general anesthesia)
- Antibiotic prophylaxis if infection risk
- Hold anticoagulation (coordinate with prescribing physician)
- Informed consent (risks, benefits, alternatives)
- Mark surgical site if applicable
- Pregnancy test in women of childbearing age
- Anesthesia consultation for complex patients

## Surgical Techniques

- Avoid routine opioid use

**Antiemetics**: For associated nausea

### Duration
- Trial period: 4-6 weeks
- Most stones that will pass do so within 4 weeks
- Earlier intervention if pain uncontrolled or complications develop

### Success Rates
- Stones <5mm: 70-80% spontaneous passage
- Stones 5-10mm: 50-60% spontaneous passage
- Distal stones: Higher passage rates
- Alpha-blockers increase success by 30%

## Stone Prevention and Metabolic Management

### General Recommendations (All Stone Formers)

**Hydration**:
- Goal: >2.5L urine output daily
- Fluid intake: 3-4L daily
- Distribute throughout day and evening
- Monitor urine color (pale yellow)

**Dietary Modifications**:
- **Sodium restriction**: <2300mg/day (reduce calcium excretion)
- **Limit animal protein**: <1g/kg/day (reduce uric acid and calcium)
- **Normal calcium intake**: 1000-1200mg/day (dietary calcium binds oxalate)
- **Limit oxalate-rich foods**: Spinach, rhubarb, nuts, chocolate, tea (if hyperoxaluria)
- **Limit vitamin C supplementation**: >1000mg increases oxalate
- **Citrus fruits**: Increase urinary citrate (protective)

### Stone Type-Specific Management

**Calcium Oxalate Stones**:
- Hydration and dietary measures above
- **Thiazide diuretics** (hypercalciuria):
  - Hydrochlorothiazide 25-50mg daily or
  - Chlorthalidone 25mg daily
  - Monitor potassium, supplement if needed
- **Potassium citrate** (hypocitraturia):
  - 30-60 mEq daily in divided doses
  - Raises urinary pH and citrate
- **Allopurinol** (hyperuricosuria): 100-300mg daily

**Calcium Phosphate Stones**:
- Often associated with high urine pH
- Limit alkali intake
- Avoid urine alkalinization
- May need acidification

**Uric Acid Stones**:
- **Hydration**: Critical
- **Urine alkalinization**:
  - Target pH 6.5-7.0
  - Potassium citrate 30-60 mEq daily
  - Monitor pH with urine strips
- **Allopurinol** (hyperuricosuria):
  - 100-300mg daily
  - Reduces uric acid production
- **Febuxostat**: Alternative xanthine oxidase inhibitor
- **Diet**: Limit purine-rich foods (organ meats, shellfish, alcohol)

**Struvite Stones**:
- Complete stone removal essential
- Long-term antibiotic suppression
- Treat underlying UTIs
- Urease inhibitors (acetohydroxamic acid) - rarely used due to side effects
- Acidify urine if possible

**Cystine Stones**:
- Aggressive hydration (>4L/day, goal urine output >3L)
- Urine alkalinization (pH >7.0)
  - Potassium citrate
  - Sodium bicarbonate
- **Thiol-binding drugs** (if conservative measures fail):
  - Tiopronin (preferred, fewer side effects)
  - D-penicillamine
  - Monitor for side effects (rash, proteinuria, cytopenias)
- Methionine restriction

### Follow-Up
- Repeat metabolic evaluation after 3-6 months of treatment
- Annual 24-hour urine collection
- Imaging (KUB, ultrasound) to monitor for recurrence
- Reinforce dietary and fluid recommendations
- Medication compliance assessment

## Postoperative Management

### Immediate Postoperative Period

**After ESWL**:
- Same-day discharge typical
- Oral analgesics (NSAIDs, opioids as needed)
- Hydration instructions
- Strain urine for fragments
- Return precautions (fever, severe pain, inability to void)
- Follow-up in 2 weeks with imaging

**After URS**:
- Same-day or 23-hour discharge
- Stent management if placed:
  - Stent discomfort expectations
  - Alpha-blockers (tamsulosin) for symptoms
  - Anticholinergics if urgency/frequency
  - Removal in 5-10 days
- Hydration
- Antibiotics if high-risk
- Pain management
- Follow-up for stent removal

**After PCNL**:
- Hospital admission (1-3 days typical)
- Monitor vital signs and hematocrit
- Nephrostomy tube care:
  - Flush if ordered
  - Monitor output
  - Secure to prevent dislodgement
- Antegrade study before tube removal
- Staged PCNL if residual stones
- Pain management (patient-controlled analgesia initially)
- Ambulation when stable
- Follow-up in 1-2 weeks

### Complications Management

**Steinstrasse**:
- Column of stone fragments obstructing ureter
- Occurs in 4-7% after ESWL
- Management:
  - Observation with hydration and MET
  - Ureteroscopy for persistent obstruction
  - Stent placement to relieve obstruction
  - Rarely need PCNL

**Infection/Sepsis**:
- More common with infected/obstructed stones
- Broad-spectrum antibiotics
- Urgent decompression:
  - Percutaneous nephrostomy or
  - Ureteral stent placement
- ICU care for severe sepsis
- Source control essential

**Bleeding After PCNL**:
- Minor hematuria expected
- Significant bleeding:
  - Transfusion support
  - Clamp nephrostomy tube temporarily
  - CT angiography if persistent
  - Angioembolization for arterial bleeding
  - Rarely nephrectomy

**Ureteral Injury**:
- Perforation during URS:
  - Usually managed with prolonged stenting (4-6 weeks)
  - Percutaneous nephrostomy if extensive
  - Rarely need open repair
- Stricture (late complication):
  - Endoscopic management (dilation, laser incision)
  - Stenting
  - Open repair if severe

## Outcomes and Prognosis

### Stone-Free Rates (Single Procedure)
- **ESWL**: 60-90% depending on stone size/location
- **URS**: 85-95% for most stones
- **PCNL**: 85-95% for kidney stones
- **Combination therapy**: May improve rates

### Factors Affecting Success
- **Stone size**: Larger stones have lower success with less invasive methods
- **Stone location**: Lower pole stones more difficult
- **Stone composition**: Harder stones (cystine, calcium oxalate monohydrate) more resistant
- **Anatomy**: Abnormalities reduce success
- **Body habitus**: Obesity affects ESWL penetration

### Recurrence
- Overall recurrence rate: 50% at 10 years without prevention
- With prevention measures: 15-20% recurrence
- Importance of metabolic evaluation and prevention strategies
- Long-term follow-up necessary

### Quality of Life
- Most patients return to normal activities within 1-2 weeks
- Minimally invasive techniques reduce convalescence
- Chronic pain uncommon after successful treatment
- Recurrent stone formers may have anxiety about recurrence
- Prevention counseling improves patient confidence
