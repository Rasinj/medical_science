# Bladder Disorders: Cancer and Incontinence

## Overview

Bladder disorders encompass a spectrum of conditions from bladder cancer to functional problems like urinary incontinence. Bladder cancer is the sixth most common malignancy in the United States, with most cases being urothelial carcinoma. Urinary incontinence affects millions, particularly women and elderly patients, significantly impacting quality of life. Modern management ranges from minimally invasive endoscopic procedures to radical surgery with urinary diversion, as well as conservative and surgical treatments for incontinence.

## Bladder Cancer

### Epidemiology
- **Incidence**: ~80,000 new cases annually in US
- **Male predominance**: 3-4:1 ratio
- **Peak age**: 70-80 years
- **Mortality**: ~17,000 deaths annually
- **Survival**: 5-year survival 77% overall (stage-dependent)

### Risk Factors
**Smoking**: #1 modifiable risk factor (4-fold increased risk)
- Responsible for 50% of bladder cancers
- Risk persists years after cessation

**Occupational Exposures**:
- Aromatic amines (benzidine, beta-naphthylamine)
- Industries: Dye, rubber, leather, painting, printing
- Latency period: 20-40 years

**Other Risk Factors**:
- **Chronic cystitis**: Schistosomiasis (squamous cell carcinoma)
- **Radiation**: Pelvic radiation for other cancers
- **Chemotherapy**: Cyclophosphamide (hemorrhagic cystitis, cancer risk)
- **Aristolochic acid**: Herbal remedies (Balkan nephropathy)
- **Genetic**: Lynch syndrome, certain polymorphisms

### Pathology

**Histologic Types**:
- **Urothelial (transitional cell) carcinoma**: 90%
  - Papillary vs. sessile growth patterns
  - Variants: Micropapillary, plasmacytoid, sarcomatoid (worse prognosis)
- **Squamous cell carcinoma**: 3-5% (schistosomiasis, chronic irritation)
- **Adenocarcinoma**: 1-2% (urachal remnants, bladder exstrophy)
- **Small cell carcinoma**: <1% (aggressive, poor prognosis)

**Molecular Subtypes** (Urothelial Carcinoma):
- Luminal, basal, neuronal subtypes
- FGFR3 mutations (good prognosis, targetable)
- TP53 mutations (poor prognosis)
- PD-L1 expression (immunotherapy response)

### Classification

**Non-Muscle-Invasive Bladder Cancer (NMIBC)** - 75% at presentation:
- **Ta**: Papillary tumor confined to mucosa
- **Tis**: Carcinoma in situ (flat high-grade)
- **T1**: Invades lamina propria (submucosa)

**Muscle-Invasive Bladder Cancer (MIBC)** - 25% at presentation:
- **T2**: Invades muscularis propria
  - T2a: Superficial muscle
  - T2b: Deep muscle
- **T3**: Invades perivesical tissue
  - T3a: Microscopic
  - T3b: Macroscopic (extravesical mass)
- **T4**: Invades adjacent organs
  - T4a: Prostate, uterus, vagina, bowel
  - T4b: Pelvic or abdominal wall

**Nodal/Metastatic Disease**:
- **N1**: Single regional node <2cm
- **N2**: Single node 2-5cm or multiple <5cm
- **N3**: Node >5cm
- **M1**: Distant metastases

**Grade**:
- **Low grade**: Well-differentiated, favorable prognosis
- **High grade**: Poorly differentiated, aggressive behavior

### Clinical Presentation

**Hematuria** (80-90%):
- Gross (visible) or microscopic
- Painless, intermittent
- Terminal hematuria (end of stream) suggests bladder origin

**Irritative Voiding Symptoms** (20-30%):
- Urgency, frequency, dysuria
- May suggest carcinoma in situ

**Advanced Disease**:
- Pelvic pain
- Flank pain (ureteral obstruction, hydronephrosis)
- Lower extremity edema (lymphatic/venous obstruction)
- Weight loss, bone pain (metastases)

### Diagnostic Evaluation

**Urinalysis and Cytology**:
- Urinalysis: Hematuria confirmation
- **Urine cytology**:
  - High sensitivity for high-grade and CIS (80-90%)
  - Low sensitivity for low-grade tumors (20-40%)
  - High specificity (>95%)
- **Urine markers**: UroVysion FISH, NMP22, BTAstat (adjunctive, not diagnostic)

**Cystoscopy** (Gold Standard):
- **Office flexible cystoscopy**:
  - Visualize bladder mucosa
  - Identify tumors (size, location, number, appearance)
  - Blue light cystoscopy improves CIS detection
- Findings: Papillary lesions, sessile tumors, erythematous patches (CIS)

**Imaging**:
- **CT urography**: Upper tract evaluation, staging
  - Assess kidneys, ureters for synchronous tumors
  - Lymph nodes, liver, lungs for metastases
- **MRI pelvis**: Local staging (muscle invasion, extravesical extension)
- **Chest CT**: Metastatic evaluation
- **Bone scan**: If symptoms or elevated alkaline phosphatase
- **PET/CT**: Emerging role in advanced disease

**Transurethral Resection of Bladder Tumor (TURBT)**:
- Diagnostic and therapeutic
- Provides tissue for histology, grade, and stage
- Complete resection if feasible

### Staging Workup

**Non-Muscle-Invasive**:
- Cystoscopy with TURBT
- CT urography (upper tracts)
- No further staging if confirmed NMIBC

**Muscle-Invasive**:
- CT chest/abdomen/pelvis or CT urography
- Consider MRI pelvis (local staging)
- Consider PET/CT if oligometastatic disease
- Bone scan if symptomatic

### Treatment: Non-Muscle-Invasive Bladder Cancer (NMIBC)

#### Transurethral Resection of Bladder Tumor (TURBT)

**Technique**:
1. Cystoscopy and tumor identification
2. **Resection**:
   - Papillary tumors: Resect at base with margin of normal mucosa
   - Flat lesions (CIS): Multiple biopsies
3. **Deep resection**: Include muscle in specimen (critical for staging)
4. **Separate fragments**: Submit separately (exophytic tumor, tumor base with muscle)
5. **Hemostasis**: Cautery, fulguration
6. **Catheter placement**: Brief (overnight or removed in OR)

**Postoperative Care**:
- Catheter typically removed day of surgery or POD 1
- Avoid anticoagulation for 1-2 weeks
- Hematuria expected (usually resolves within days)
- Intravesical therapy (see below)

**Complications**:
- **Bladder perforation** (3-5%):
  - Extraperitoneal: Catheter drainage 5-7 days
  - Intraperitoneal: May need open repair, antibiotics
- **Bleeding**: Usually minor, managed conservatively
- **Obturator reflex**: Leg adduction during resection (lateral wall tumors)
- **UTI**: 2-5%
- **TUR syndrome**: Rare with bipolar resection

#### Intravesical Therapy

**Indications**:
- Reduce recurrence risk
- Treat residual disease
- Prevent progression (high-risk disease)

**Single Immediate Post-Operative Instillation**:
- **Mitomycin C** or **gemcitabine** within 24 hours of TURBT
- Reduces recurrence by 30-40%
- Contraindicated if perforation suspected
- All patients unless contraindicated

**BCG (Bacillus Calmette-Guérin) Therapy**:
- **Indications**:
  - High-grade Ta, T1
  - Carcinoma in situ (CIS)
  - Intermediate-risk with high recurrence rate

  - Weekly instillations for 6 weeks
  - Start 2-6 weeks after TURBT (allow healing)

- **Maintenance**:
  - Reduces recurrence and progression
  - Weekly × 3 weeks at 3, 6 months, then every 6 months for 3 years
  - Alternative: Monthly or other schedules

- **Administration**:
  - Hold for 2 hours if possible
  - Void after 2 hours
  - Hydrate before (concentrated urine irritates)

- **Response Rates**:
  - CIS complete response: 70-80%
  - Recurrence reduction: 30-40% vs. TURBT alone
  - Progression reduction: 27% (vs. TURBT alone)

- **Side Effects**:
  - **Irritative symptoms** (common): Dysuria, frequency, urgency (30-40%)
    - Usually mild, peaks at 3-6 hours post-instillation
  - **Hematuria** (10-20%)
  - **Fever** (2-3%): Low-grade usually, treat with NSAIDs
  - **BCG sepsis** (<1%): High fever, hypotension
    - Stop BCG, anti-TB therapy (isoniazid, rifampin, fluoroquinolone)
    - Consult infectious disease
  - **Granulomatous prostatitis** (rare)

- **Contraindications**:

  - Side effects: Dysuria, rash (allergic reaction 10%)

- **Gemcitabine**:
  - Emerging alternative to BCG
  - Better tolerated than mitomycin
  - Weekly × 6, then monthly

**BCG-Unresponsive Disease**:
- Defined as persistent/recurrent high-grade after adequate BCG
- **Options**:
  - Radical cystectomy (preferred)
  - Clinical trials
  - Pembrolizumab (immunotherapy, FDA-approved for CIS)
  - Repeat BCG (lower success rates)
  - Intravesical chemotherapy (gemcitabine/docetaxel)

#### Surveillance for NMIBC
