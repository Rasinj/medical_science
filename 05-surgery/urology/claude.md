# Urology

## Overview

Urology is the surgical specialty focused on diseases of the male and female urinary tract and the male reproductive system. Urological surgery encompasses procedures ranging from minimally invasive endoscopic techniques to major open and robotic operations. The field addresses both benign conditions (stones, prostatic hyperplasia, incontinence) and malignancies (kidney, bladder, prostate, testicular cancers).

## Learning Objectives

- Understand urological anatomy and surgical approaches
- Master diagnostic evaluation of urological conditions
- Learn minimally invasive and open surgical techniques
- Recognize perioperative complications and management
- Apply evidence-based treatment algorithms

## Clinical Applications

- Preoperative assessment and patient selection
- Intraoperative decision-making and technique
- Postoperative care and complication management
- Long-term follow-up and surveillance
- Multidisciplinary cancer care

## Surgical Principles

### Minimally Invasive Approaches
- **Endoscopic Surgery**: Ureteroscopy, cystoscopy, TURP
- **Laparoscopic Surgery**: Nephrectomy, prostatectomy, pyeloplasty
- **Robotic Surgery**: Prostatectomy, partial nephrectomy, cystectomy
- **Percutaneous Techniques**: PCNL, nephrostomy, ablation

### Open Surgical Techniques
- **Radical Procedures**: Cystectomy, nephrectomy, prostatectomy
- **Reconstructive Surgery**: Urinary diversion, bladder reconstruction
- **Complex Cases**: Retroperitoneal tumors, vascular involvement

### Stone Management
- **Extracorporeal Lithotripsy**: Non-invasive stone fragmentation
- **Ureteroscopy**: Flexible and rigid techniques
- **Percutaneous Nephrolithotomy**: Large stone burden

## Perioperative Care

### Preoperative Assessment
- Renal function evaluation (GFR, creatinine)
- Cardiovascular risk stratification
- Anticoagulation management
- Bowel preparation for major surgery
- Patient counseling and informed consent

### Postoperative Management
- Pain control and early mobilization
- Drain and catheter management
- Monitoring for complications
- Preventing thromboembolic events
- Rehabilitation and recovery

## Complications and Management

### Early Complications
- **Bleeding**: Monitoring, transfusion, re-exploration
- **Urinary Leak**: Drain output, imaging, prolonged catheterization
- **Infection**: Antibiotics, source control
- **Ileus**: Conservative management, decompression

### Late Complications
- **Stricture Formation**: Ureteral, urethral stenosis
- **Incontinence**: Conservative and surgical management
- **Erectile Dysfunction**: Counseling, medications, prosthetics
- **Chronic Pain**: Neuropathic pain management

## Cancer Management

### Urological Malignancies
- **Renal Cell Carcinoma**: Staging, surgical management, targeted therapy
- **Bladder Cancer**: TURBT, intravesical therapy, radical cystectomy
- **Prostate Cancer**: Active surveillance, surgery, radiation
- **Testicular Cancer**: Orchiectomy, chemotherapy, RPLND

### Multidisciplinary Approach
- Tumor boards and case conferences
- Medical oncology collaboration
- Radiation oncology planning
- Palliative care integration

## Quality and Outcomes

### Outcome Measures
- Cancer-specific and overall survival
- Continence rates after prostatectomy
- Stone-free rates after lithotripsy
- Quality of life assessments
- Complication rates and severity

### Quality Improvement
- Surgical site infection prevention
- Enhanced recovery protocols
- Patient-reported outcomes
- Standardized surgical techniques
- Complication tracking and learning

## Key Points

- Urological surgery ranges from minimally invasive to complex open procedures
- Stone disease management emphasizes minimally invasive techniques
- Prostate cancer treatment requires careful patient selection and counseling
- Bladder cancer may require radical surgery with urinary diversion
- Renal surgery increasingly utilizes nephron-sparing approaches
- Perioperative care focuses on preserving renal function and continence
- Complications include bleeding, infection, strictures, and functional deficits
- Multidisciplinary care is essential for urological malignancies
- Quality outcomes emphasize cancer control and functional preservation
- Robotic and laparoscopic approaches dominate contemporary practice
