# Prostate Disease: Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia and Prostate Cancer

## Overview

Prostatic diseases, particularly benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and prostate cancer, represent the most common urological conditions affecting men. BPH affects over 50% of men in their 60s and 90% by age 85, causing bothersome lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). Prostate cancer is the most common non-cutaneous malignancy in men and the second leading cause of cancer death. Modern management ranges from watchful waiting and medical therapy to minimally invasive procedures and radical surgery.

### Prostatic Anatomy
- **Zones**: Peripheral (70%, most cancers), central (25%), transition (5%, BPH growth), anterior fibromuscular
- **Size**: Normal 20-30g, increases with age
- **Blood supply**: Inferior vesical and middle rectal arteries
- **Lymphatic drainage**: Obturator, hypogastric, common iliac nodes
- **Innervation**: Autonomic nerves (neurovascular bundles) control erectile function

## Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH)

### Pathophysiology
- Proliferation of epithelial and stromal cells in transition zone
- Hormonal factors: Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) role
- Age-related increase in estrogen/androgen ratio
- Genetic predisposition
- Growth factors and inflammation

### Clinical Presentation

**Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms (LUTS)**:

**Storage Symptoms**:
- Urinary frequency (>8 voids/day)
- Nocturia (>1 void/night)
- Urgency
- Urge incontinence

**Voiding Symptoms**:
- Weak stream
- Hesitancy
- Intermittency
- Straining
- Prolonged voiding
- Incomplete emptying
- Post-void dribbling

**Complications**:
- Acute urinary retention
- Chronic urinary retention with overflow incontinence
- Bladder stones
- Recurrent urinary tract infections
- Hydronephrosis and renal insufficiency
- Gross hematuria

### Diagnostic Evaluation

**History**:
- International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS)
  - 7 questions scored 0-5 (0-35 total)
  - 0-7: Mild symptoms
  - 8-19: Moderate symptoms
  - 20-35: Severe symptoms
- Quality of life question
- Sexual function assessment
- Medical history (neurological conditions, diabetes)
- Medication review (anticholinergics, alpha-agonists)

**Physical Examination**:
- Digital rectal examination (DRE):
  - Prostate size estimation
  - Consistency, nodules, asymmetry
  - Anal sphincter tone (neurological assessment)
- Abdominal examination (distended bladder, masses)
- Focused neurological examination

**Laboratory Studies**:
- Urinalysis (infection, hematuria)
- Urine culture if infection suspected
- Prostate-specific antigen (PSA):
  - Cancer screening (if appropriate)
  - Reflects prostate volume (0.3-0.4 ng/mL per gram)
- Serum creatinine (renal function)

**Objective Testing**:
- **Post-void residual (PVR)**:
  - Bladder ultrasound or catheterization
  - Normal: <50 mL
  - >200 mL suggests significant retention
- **Uroflowmetry**:
  - Maximum flow rate (Qmax)
  - Normal: >15 mL/sec
  - <10 mL/sec suggests obstruction
  - Voided volume should be >150 mL
- **Urodynamics** (selected cases):
  - Distinguishes obstruction from detrusor underactivity
  - Indicated if diagnosis uncertain or neurological concerns
- **Cystoscopy** (selected cases):
  - Hematuria evaluation
  - Assess prostate size and configuration
  - Rule out bladder pathology

**Imaging**:
- Renal/bladder ultrasound: Hydronephrosis, stones, bladder abnormalities
- Prostate ultrasound (transrectal): Volume measurement
- CT/MRI: Not routine for BPH evaluation

### Medical Management

**Watchful Waiting**:
- Mild symptoms (IPSS <8)
- No bothersome symptoms
- No complications
- Patient preference
- Annual monitoring

**Alpha-Blockers** (First-line for LUTS):
- **Selective α1A antagonists**:
  - Tamsulosin 0.4mg daily
  - Silodosin 8mg daily
  - Fewer cardiovascular side effects
- **Non-selective α1 antagonists**:
  - Alfuzosin 10mg daily
  - Doxazosin 1-8mg daily (titrate)
  - Terazosin 1-10mg daily (titrate)
- **Mechanism**: Relax prostatic and bladder neck smooth muscle
- **Onset**: Rapid (days to weeks)
- **Efficacy**: IPSS improvement 30-40%, Qmax increase 20-25%
- **Side effects**: Orthostatic hypotension, dizziness, retrograde ejaculation

**5-Alpha Reductase Inhibitors** (for enlarged prostates >40g):
- **Medications**:
  - Finasteride 5mg daily (Type II inhibitor)
  - Dutasteride 0.5mg daily (Type I and II inhibitor)
- **Mechanism**: Inhibit conversion of testosterone to DHT, reduce prostate volume
- **Onset**: Slow (3-6 months for maximal effect)
- **Efficacy**: 20-30% prostate volume reduction, IPSS improvement 30%, Qmax increase 1-2 mL/sec
- **Benefits**: Reduce acute retention risk by 50%, reduce need for surgery
- **Side effects**: Sexual dysfunction (erectile dysfunction, decreased libido, ejaculatory disorders), gynecomastia
- **PSA**: Reduces PSA by 50% (double the value for cancer screening)

**Combination Therapy**:
- Alpha-blocker + 5-ARI
- More effective than monotherapy for large prostates
- MTOPS trial: Reduced progression by 66% vs. placebo
- CombAT trial: Superior symptom improvement

**Anticholinergics/Beta-3 Agonists** (for storage symptoms):
- Used if urgency/frequency predominant
- Risk of urinary retention (caution with PVR >250 mL)
- Often combined with alpha-blockers
- **Medications**:
  - Mirabegron 25-50mg daily (beta-3 agonist)
  - Oxybutynin, tolterodine, solifenacin (anticholinergics)

**Phosphodiesterase-5 Inhibitors**:
- Tadalafil 5mg daily FDA-approved for BPH/LUTS
- Mechanism unclear (smooth muscle relaxation, pelvic blood flow)
- Benefit for concomitant erectile dysfunction

### Indications for Surgical Intervention

**Absolute Indications**:
- Refractory urinary retention (failed trial without catheter)
- Recurrent urinary tract infections due to BPH
- Bladder stones secondary to BPH

## Prostate Cancer

### Epidemiology
- Most common non-cutaneous cancer in men
- Second leading cause of cancer death (after lung)
- Lifetime risk: 1 in 8 men
- Median age at diagnosis: 66 years
- Higher incidence in African American men
- Family history increases risk (BRCA2, other genes)

### Risk Factors
- **Age**: Strongest risk factor
- **Race**: African American > Caucasian > Asian
- **Family history**: 2-3x risk with first-degree relative
- **Genetic mutations**: BRCA1/2, Lynch syndrome
- **Diet**: High fat diet (possible association)
- **Obesity**: Associated with aggressive disease

### Screening and Detection

**Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA)**:
- Serine protease, prostate-specific but not cancer-specific
- Elevated in: Cancer, BPH, prostatitis, manipulation
- Normal: <4.0 ng/mL (age-adjusted ranges exist)
- Gray zone: 4-10 ng/mL (cancer risk ~25%)
- >10 ng/mL: Higher cancer risk (~50%)

**PSA Derivatives**:
- **PSA velocity**: Rate of rise (>0.75 ng/mL/year concerning)
- **PSA density**: PSA/prostate volume (>0.15 concerning)
- **Free PSA**: % free PSA (lower % = higher cancer risk; <10% concerning)
- **4K score, PHI, PCA3**: Newer markers to refine risk

**Screening Recommendations**:
- **USPSTF (2018)**: Individualized decision-making ages 55-69
- **AUA**: Shared decision-making ages 55-69
- **NCCN**: Consider starting at age 45 for high-risk (African American, family history)
- **Start earlier**: Strong family history, BRCA mutations
- **PSA every 2-4 years** if screening elected
- **Stop screening**: Age >70 or life expectancy <10 years

**Digital Rectal Examination**:
- Palpate for nodules, asymmetry, induration
- Abnormal DRE warrants biopsy regardless of PSA
- Limited sensitivity for cancer detection

### Diagnosis

**Indications for Biopsy**:
- Elevated PSA (>4 ng/mL, rising trend)
- Abnormal DRE (nodule, induration)
- Abnormal imaging (MRI)

**Biopsy Technique**:
- **Transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) guided**: Traditional approach
- **MRI-fusion biopsy**: Targets MRI-visible lesions, improves detection of significant cancer
- **Transperineal approach**: Lower infection risk
- **Systematic sampling**: 12-core extended sextant
- **Targeted sampling**: MRI-visible lesions

**Pathology**:
- **Adenocarcinoma**: 95% of prostate cancers
- **Gleason Score/Grade Group**:
  - Gleason 6 (3+3) = Grade Group 1
  - Gleason 7 (3+4) = Grade Group 2
  - Gleason 7 (4+3) = Grade Group 3
  - Gleason 8 (4+4, 3+5, 5+3) = Grade Group 4
  - Gleason 9-10 = Grade Group 5
- **Perineural invasion, extraprostatic extension**: Adverse features
- **% cores positive, % cancer in cores**: Tumor burden

**Staging (TNM)**:
- **T1**: Nonpalpable, incidental
- **T2**: Palpable, confined to prostate
- **T3**: Extraprostatic extension or seminal vesicle invasion
- **T4**: Invasion of adjacent structures
- **N**: Lymph node involvement
- **M**: Metastatic disease

**Imaging**:
- **Multiparametric MRI**: Best for local staging, detect significant cancer
- **Bone scan**: If PSA >20, high-grade, symptomatic
- **CT abdomen/pelvis**: Lymph node evaluation if high-risk
- **PSMA PET**: Emerging, high sensitivity for metastatic disease
- **Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) imaging**: Increasing use for staging and recurrence

### Risk Stratification

**NCCN Risk Groups**:

**Very Low Risk**:

  - Single procedure
  - Dose delivered over months
- **High-dose rate (HDR)**: Temporary catheter placement
  - Boost with EBRT or monotherapy
  - Higher doses to prostate

**Androgen Deprivation Therapy (ADT) with Radiation**:
- **Intermediate-risk**: 4-6 months ADT
- **High-risk**: 24-36 months ADT
- Improves outcomes with EBRT

**Outcomes**:
- Biochemical control comparable to surgery for low/intermediate-risk

#### Management of Metastatic Disease

**Hormone-Sensitive Metastatic Prostate Cancer**:
- **ADT + docetaxel**: Improves survival
- **ADT + abiraterone or enzalutamide**: Improves survival
- **ADT + radiation** to prostate (low metastatic burden): Potential benefit

**Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer (CRPC)**:

  - PARP inhibitors (olaparib, rucaparib) for BRCA mutations
  - Lutetium-177 PSMA therapy

**Bone Health**:
- Bisphosphonates (zoledronic acid) or denosumab
- Prevent skeletal-related events
- Improve bone density

### Biochemical Recurrence After Primary Therapy

**Definition**:
- **After prostatectomy**: PSA ≥0.2 ng/mL on two occasions
- **After radiation**: PSA rise ≥2 ng/mL above nadir (Phoenix criteria)

**Evaluation**:
- PSA doubling time (PSADT)
- PSMA PET or conventional imaging (CT, bone scan)
- Consider biopsy if local recurrence suspected

**Management**:

**After Prostatectomy**:
- **Salvage radiation**: 64-72 Gy to prostate bed
  - Best results if PSA <0.5 ng/mL
  - Consider ADT (6 months) if high-risk features
- **Observation**: If PSADT >12 months, older patients
- **ADT**: Palliative, delay metastases

**After Radiation**:
- **Salvage prostatectomy**: Selected patients
  - Higher complication rates (incontinence 50%, ED >90%)
- **Salvage cryotherapy or HIFU**: Focal or whole-gland
- **ADT**: Most common approach
