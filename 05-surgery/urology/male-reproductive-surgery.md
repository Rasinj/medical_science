# Male Reproductive Surgery

## Overview

Male reproductive surgery encompasses a diverse range of procedures addressing fertility, oncologic, congenital, traumatic, and functional conditions of the male reproductive system. Common procedures include vasectomy for contraception, vasovasostomy for reversal, orchiectomy for testicular cancer, penile prosthesis implantation for erectile dysfunction, and surgical management of male infertility. These procedures range from simple office-based interventions to complex microsurgical reconstructions requiring specialized training and equipment.

### Male Reproductive Anatomy

**Testes**:
- Paired ovoid organs (4-5cm length, 3cm width)
- Seminiferous tubules (sperm production)
- Leydig cells (testosterone production)
- Tunica vaginalis (peritoneal covering)
- Tunica albuginea (fibrous capsule)

**Epididymis**:
- Coiled tubular structure on posterior testis
- Sperm maturation and storage (10-14 days transit)
- Head, body, tail regions

**Vas Deferens**:
- Muscular tube (30-35cm length)
- Transports sperm from epididymis to ejaculatory duct
- Palpable in spermatic cord

**Spermatic Cord**:
- Vas deferens, testicular artery, pampiniform venous plexus
- Cremasteric vessels, lymphatics, nerves
- Cremaster muscle

**Penis**:
- Paired corpora cavernosa (erectile tissue)
- Corpus spongiosum (surrounds urethra)
- Glans penis
- Penile skin (foreskin in uncircumcised)

**Prostate and Seminal Vesicles**:
- Contribute to seminal fluid
- Ejaculatory ducts join vas deferens and seminal vesicle duct

## Vasectomy

### Overview
- Most common surgical procedure for male contraception
- 500,000 performed annually in United States
- Highly effective, permanent sterilization (99.9% effective)
- Failure rate: 1 in 2,000

### Indications
- Permanent contraception desired
- Completed family planning
- Medical contraindication to female contraception
- Patient/couple preference

### Contraindications
- Uncertain about future fertility desires
- Coercion by partner
- Active scrotal infection or inflammation
- Large varicocele or hydrocele (obscures anatomy)
- Bleeding disorder (relative)

### Preoperative Counseling

**Critical Points**:
- **Permanence**: Should be considered irreversible (though reversal possible)
- **Not immediate**: Requires 20-30 ejaculations or 3 months to clear sperm
- **Post-procedure semen analysis**: Confirm azoospermia before relying on procedure
- **No STI protection**: Does not prevent sexually transmitted infections
- **Minimal complications**: Very safe procedure
- **No effect on sexual function**: Libido, erections, ejaculation unchanged (volume minimally decreased)
- **Reversal**: Possible but not guaranteed success (50-90% patency, 30-75% pregnancy rates)

**Informed Consent**:
- Risks, benefits, alternatives
- Possibility of failure
- Post-vasectomy pain syndrome (rare)
- Reversal limitations

### Surgical Technique

**Anesthesia**:
- Local anesthesia (lidocaine 1% with epinephrine)
- Spermatic cord block (inject along vas)
- Minimal sedation if needed

**Traditional Vasectomy**:
1. **Patient positioning**: Supine, scrotum shaved
2. **Identify vas**: Palpate vas through scrotal skin (cord-like structure)
3. **Anesthesia**: Inject local around vas
4. **Incision**: 1-2cm scrotal incision (midline or bilateral)
5. **Isolate vas**: Grasp vas with Allis clamp, deliver through incision
6. **Resect segment**: Remove 1-2cm of vas
7. **Occlude ends**:
   - Options: Ligation (suture), cautery (intraluminal), clips
   - Techniques: Open-ended, closed-ended, fascial interposition
8. **Fascial interposition**: Separate vas ends with fascial layer (reduces recanalization)
9. **Return vas to scrotum**
10. **Closure**: Absorbable suture or tissue adhesive
11. **Repeat on contralateral side** (if single incision) or perform separate incision

**No-Scalpel Vasectomy (NSV)**:
- Popularized technique, minimally invasive
- **Instruments**: Ringed forceps, sharp dissecting forceps
- **Technique**:
  1. Isolate vas with ringed forceps (external fixation)
  2. Puncture skin and vas sheath with sharp forceps (no scalpel incision)
  3. Deliver vas through puncture
  4. Occlude vas (as above)
  5. Return vas to scrotum
  6. No sutures needed (puncture self-seals)
- **Advantages**: Less bleeding, less pain, faster recovery, fewer complications

**Occlusion Methods**:
- **Ligation and excision**: Traditional
- **Cautery**: Thermal coagulation (intraluminal cautery most effective)
- **Clips**: Titanium or plastic clips
- **Fascial interposition**: Separate vas ends with fascial layer (reduces recanalization by 50%)
- **Open-ended technique**: Leave testicular end open (may reduce pain but slightly higher failure)

**Bilateral vs. Single Incision**:
- Bilateral incisions: Two separate scrotal incisions
- Single midline incision: Access both vas through one incision
- No-scalpel: Can be performed through single puncture

### Postoperative Care

**Immediate Post-Procedure**:
- Ice packs to scrotum (reduce swelling)
- Supportive underwear (snug-fitting briefs or jockstrap)
- Resume activity as tolerated (avoid strenuous activity 1 week)
- Sexual activity: Resume after 1 week or when comfortable

**Pain Management**:
- Acetaminophen or NSAIDs (ibuprofen)
- Usually minimal discomfort (2-3 days)
- Prescription opioids rarely needed

**Follow-Up**:
- **Semen analysis**:
  - Perform at 8-16 weeks or after 20-30 ejaculations
  - Success: Azoospermia or rare non-motile sperm (<100,000/mL)
  - If persistent motile sperm: Repeat analysis, consider repeat vasectomy
- **Contraception**: Continue alternative contraception until azoospermia confirmed

**Return to Activities**:
- Light activity: 2-3 days
- Heavy lifting, strenuous exercise: 1 week
- Sexual activity: 1 week

### Complications

**Early Complications**:
- **Hematoma** (1-2%):
  - Scrotal swelling and ecchymosis
  - Usually resolves spontaneously
  - Large hematomas may need drainage
- **Infection** (<1%):
  - Erythema, tenderness, drainage
  - Antibiotics (cover skin flora)
  - Rarely requires drainage
- **Bleeding**: Usually minor

**Late Complications**:
- **Sperm granuloma** (1-3%):
  - Inflammatory reaction to extravasated sperm
  - Tender nodule at vasectomy site or epididymis
  - Usually resolves with conservative management (NSAIDs)
  - Rarely requires excision
- **Chronic scrotal pain** (1-2%):
  - Persistent pain >3 months post-vasectomy
  - Etiology: Sperm granuloma, epididymal congestion, nerve entrapment
  - Management: NSAIDs, nerve blocks, epididymectomy (rare)
- **Failure/recanalization** (1 in 2,000):
  - Early recanalization (<3 months)
  - Late recanalization (rare, >1 year)
  - Present with pregnancy or motile sperm on semen analysis
  - Treatment: Repeat vasectomy

**Systemic Concerns**:
- No increased risk of prostate cancer, testicular cancer, cardiovascular disease
- Antisperm antibodies develop (50-70%) - no clinical significance

## Vasovasostomy (Vasectomy Reversal)

### Overview
- Microsurgical reanastomosis of vas deferens
- Success depends on time since vasectomy, surgeon expertise, obstruction level
- Patency rates: 80-95% (sperm in ejaculate)
- Pregnancy rates: 40-80% (depends on female partner fertility)

### Indications
- Desire for future fertility after vasectomy
- New relationship
- Change in family planning
- Death of child

### Preoperative Evaluation

**Patient Assessment**:
- Time since vasectomy (affects success)
- Previous scrotal surgery
- Female partner evaluation (age, fertility assessment)
- Consider sperm retrieval + IVF if low success likelihood

**Partner Evaluation**:
- Female age >40: Lower pregnancy rates (consider IVF/ICSI with sperm retrieval)
- Ovarian reserve testing
- Tubal patency assessment

**Consent**:
- Success rates (patency vs. pregnancy)
- Time to pregnancy (may take 6-24 months)
- Possibility of vasoepididymostomy if epididymal obstruction
- Alternative: Sperm retrieval + assisted reproduction

### Surgical Technique

**Anesthesia**: General anesthesia (long procedure, microsurgery)

**Approach**: Bilateral scrotal incisions

**Microsurgical Steps**:
1. **Identify vas ends**: Proximal (testicular) and distal (abdominal) ends
2. **Prepare vas ends**: Sharply transect vas to healthy tissue
3. **Assess vasal fluid**:
   - **Proximal (testicular) end**: Inspect for fluid
   - **Fluid quality**:
     - Clear with sperm: Perform vasovasostomy
     - Thick, pasty, or absent: Epididymal obstruction → vasoepididymostomy
4. **Microsurgical anastomosis**:
   - **Two-layer technique**:
     - Inner layer: Mucosa-to-mucosa (6-8 interrupted sutures, 9-0 or 10-0 nylon)
     - Outer layer: Muscularis-to-muscularis (6-8 interrupted sutures, 9-0 nylon)
   - **Optical magnification**: Surgical microscope (15-25x magnification)
5. **Hemostasis**: Meticulous control
6. **Closure**: Return vas to scrotum, close incisions

**Vasoepididymostomy**:
- Performed if epididymal obstruction (no sperm in vasal fluid)
- Anastomose vas to single epididymal tubule
- More technically challenging (lower success rates: 60-85% patency, 30-50% pregnancy)

### Postoperative Care

**Hospital Stay**: Outpatient or 23-hour observation

**Pain Management**: Opioids for 3-5 days, then NSAIDs

**Activity Restrictions**:
- Scrotal support for 2-4 weeks
- Avoid heavy lifting for 2-4 weeks
- Sexual activity: Abstain 2-4 weeks

**Follow-Up**:
- **Semen analysis**: 4-6 weeks, then every 2-3 months until pregnancy or plateau
- **Patency**: Sperm in ejaculate (any concentration)
- **Time to patency**: Average 3-6 months (may take up to 12 months)
- **Pregnancy**: May take 6-24 months

### Outcomes

**Patency Rates**:
- Vasectomy <3 years: 95-97%
- Vasectomy 3-8 years: 88-94%
- Vasectomy 9-14 years: 79-85%
- Vasectomy >15 years: 71-79%

**Pregnancy Rates**:
- Overall: 50-75%
- Depends on: Female partner age/fertility, time since vasectomy, surgeon expertise
- Higher success with shorter interval

**Predictors of Success**:
- Shorter time since vasectomy
- Presence of sperm in vasal fluid
- Female partner <40 years old
- Microsurgical technique

### Complications
- Hematoma (1-5%)
- Infection (<1%)
- Failure (no sperm in ejaculate)
- Recurrent obstruction (rare)

## Testicular Cancer Surgery

### Overview
- Most common solid malignancy in men aged 15-35 years
- Highly curable (>95% cure rate overall)
- Treatment involves radical orchiectomy ± chemotherapy/radiation/lymph node dissection

### Testicular Germ Cell Tumors

**Histology**:
- **Seminoma** (55%): Radiosensitive, better prognosis
- **Non-seminomatous germ cell tumors (NSGCT)** (45%):
  - Embryonal carcinoma, yolk sac tumor, choriocarcinoma, teratoma
  - Often mixed histology

**Presentation**:
- Painless testicular mass (most common)
- Scrotal heaviness or discomfort
- Acute pain (10%): Hemorrhage or infarction
- Back pain (retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy)
- Gynecomastia (β-hCG secreting tumors)

**Diagnosis**:
- **Scrotal ultrasound**: Confirm intratesticular mass
- **Tumor markers**: AFP (non-seminoma), β-hCG (non-seminoma, seminoma 10-15%), LDH
- **Staging CT**: Chest, abdomen, pelvis (retroperitoneal lymph nodes, metastases)
- **Brain MRI**: If high β-hCG or symptomatic

### Radical Inguinal Orchiectomy

**Indications**:
- Suspected testicular cancer (solid intratesticular mass)

**Contraindications**:
- None absolute (cancer treatment)

**Preoperative**:
- Tumor marker levels (AFP, β-hCG, LDH)
- Staging imaging
- Sperm banking (if future fertility desired and time permits)
- Testicular prosthesis counseling

**Surgical Technique**:
1. **Incision**: Inguinal incision (not scrotal - avoid scrotal lymphatic drainage)
2. **Deliver testis**: Externalize spermatic cord and testis into field
3. **Cross-clamp cord**: Vascular control at internal ring before manipulation
4. **Inspect testis**: Confirm suspicion
5. **Ligate cord**: High ligation at internal ring (prevent tumor spillage)
6. **Divide cord**: Remove testis with spermatic cord
7. **Hemostasis**: Ensure no bleeding
8. **Testicular prosthesis** (optional): Saline-filled silicone prosthesis in scrotum
9. **Closure**: Layer closure

**Frozen Section**: Not routinely performed (high accuracy of ultrasound + markers)

**Testis-Sparing Surgery**:
- Very select cases: Bilateral tumors, solitary testis, small mass concerning for benign
- Partial orchiectomy with frozen section
- Risk of recurrence

### Postoperative Care
- Same-day discharge typical
- Pain management (NSAIDs, opioids short-term)
- Scrotal support
- Activity: Resume as tolerated (avoid heavy lifting 2 weeks)
- Follow-up: Review pathology, plan adjuvant treatment

### Retroperitoneal Lymph Node Dissection (RPLND)

**Indications**:
- **Clinical stage I NSGCT** (selected patients): Alternative to surveillance
- **Clinical stage IIA/B NSGCT**: Post-chemotherapy residual mass >1cm
- **Relapsed seminoma**: Post-chemotherapy residual mass
- **Primary RPLND**: Some centers for stage I high-risk NSGCT

**Anatomy**:
- **Primary landing zone**: Paracaval/interaortocaval (right testis), paraaortic (left testis)
- **Boundaries**: Renal vessels to bifurcation, ureters laterally

**Surgical Approach**: Open (midline laparotomy) or laparoscopic/robotic

**Technique** (Nerve-Sparing RPLND):
1. **Incision**: Midline laparotomy
2. **Eviscerate bowel**: Retract small bowel right, mobilize colon
3. **Identify structures**: Aorta, IVC, renal vessels, ureters
4. **Sympathetic nerve identification**: Preserve sympathetic nerves (ejaculation preservation)
5. **Template dissection**:
   - Right-sided tumor: Paracaval, interaortocaval, retrocaval
   - Left-sided tumor: Paraaortic, interaortocaval
6. **Split-and-roll technique**: Dissect lymphatic tissue off great vessels
7. **Hemostasis**: Meticulous control (lumbar vessels)
8. **Nerve preservation**: Identify and preserve postganglionic sympathetic fibers
9. **Specimen removal**: En bloc lymph node packet
10. **Closure**: Reapproximate bowel, layer closure

**Modified Templates**:
- Reduce dissection extent to preserve ejaculation
- Right: Preserve left sympathetic chain
- Left: Preserve right sympathetic chain

### Postoperative Care (RPLND)
- Hospital stay: 3-5 days
- Nasogastric tube until bowel function returns
- Early ambulation
- Pain management
- Monitor for complications

### Outcomes and Complications (RPLND)

**Outcomes**:
- Cure rates >95% for stage I-IIA NSGCT
- Pathologic findings guide further treatment

**Complications**:
- **Retrograde ejaculation** (5-10% with nerve-sparing, 90% without)
- **Bleeding**: Lumbar vessels, great vessels
- **Chyle leak** (1-2%): Lymphatic disruption
- **Bowel obstruction** (5-10%)
- **Infection, ileus**: Standard surgical risks

## Penile Prosthesis Surgery

### Overview
- Surgical treatment for erectile dysfunction refractory to medical therapy
- High patient satisfaction (85-95%)
- Types: Inflatable (2-piece, 3-piece), malleable (semi-rigid)

### Indications
- Erectile dysfunction unresponsive to:
  - Oral phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors (sildenafil, tadalafil, vardenafil)
  - Intraurethral or intracavernosal injections
  - Vacuum erection devices
- Peyronie's disease with ED
- Patient preference for permanent solution

### Contraindications
- Active urinary tract infection
- Scrotal or penile infection
- Poorly controlled diabetes (increase infection risk)
- Untreated psychiatric disorder
- Unrealistic expectations

### Types of Prostheses

**3-Piece Inflatable Prosthesis** (Most Common):
- Paired cylinders in corpora cavernosa
- Scrotal pump
- Abdominal reservoir
- **Advantages**: Most natural erection and flaccidity, high satisfaction
- **Disadvantages**: Most complex, mechanical failure risk

**2-Piece Inflatable Prosthesis**:
- Paired cylinders in corpora
- Combined pump-reservoir in scrotum
- **Advantages**: Simpler than 3-piece, no abdominal reservoir
- **Disadvantages**: Less rigid erection than 3-piece

**Malleable (Semi-Rigid) Prosthesis**:
- Paired semi-rigid rods in corpora
- Bendable for positioning
- **Advantages**: Simple, no mechanical failure, lower cost
- **Disadvantages**: Constant semi-erect state, less natural

### Surgical Technique (3-Piece Inflatable)

**Anesthesia**: General or spinal

**Preoperative**:
- Antibiotic prophylaxis (infection prevention critical)
- Scrotal/pubic shave
- Genital prep (chlorhexidine or betadine)

**Approach**: Penoscrotal, infrapubic, or subcoronal

**Penoscrotal Approach** (Most Common):
1. **Incision**: Penoscrotal junction (3-4cm transverse incision)
2. **Expose corpora**: Dissect through dartos, Buck's fascia
3. **Corporal incision**: Longitudinal incision in each corpus cavernosum
4. **Corporal dilation**: Dilate corpora proximally and distally to accommodate cylinders
5. **Measure corpora**: Determine cylinder length
6. **Cylinder placement**: Insert cylinders into corpora
7. **Reservoir placement**:
   - Create space in retropubic or ectopic location (commonly between transversalis fascia and rectus muscle)
   - Fill reservoir with saline (65-100mL)
8. **Pump placement**: Create subdartos pouch in scrotum, position pump
9. **Tubing connections**: Connect cylinders, pump, reservoir
10. **Cycling**: Test device function (inflate/deflate)
11. **Closure**: Close corporal incisions, layer closure of skin

**Infection Prevention**:
- Strict sterile technique
- Antibiotic-coated implants (reduces infection)
- Minimize device handling
- Limit OR traffic

### Postoperative Care

**Hospital Stay**: Outpatient or 23-hour observation

**Catheter**: Foley overnight, remove next day

**Device Management**:
- Keep deflated for 2-6 weeks (allow healing)
- Teaching on device operation before discharge

**Pain Management**:
- Opioids short-term (3-5 days)
- NSAIDs

**Activity**:
- Resume light activity as tolerated
- No sexual activity for 6 weeks
- First inflation at 2-6 weeks (office visit or patient at home per surgeon preference)

**Follow-Up**:
- 2-4 weeks: Teach inflation/deflation
- 6 weeks: Sexual activity permitted
- As needed thereafter

### Outcomes

**Satisfaction**:
- Patient satisfaction: 85-95%
- Partner satisfaction: 75-90%
- Quality of life improvement

**Mechanical Survival**:
- 10-year mechanical survival: 75-80% (3-piece)
- 15-year mechanical survival: 60-65%
- Malleable prostheses: Lower mechanical failure

### Complications

**Infection** (1-3%):
- Most serious complication
- Higher risk: Diabetes, spinal cord injury, revision surgery
- Presentation: Erythema, pain, purulent drainage, fever
- Management: Antibiotics, often requires device removal
- Salvage techniques: Immediate replacement with washout

**Mechanical Failure** (5-10% at 5 years):
- Cylinder leak, pump failure, tubing kink/leak
- Requires revision surgery

**Erosion** (<1%):
- Cylinder erodes through corporal tissue or urethra
- Requires device removal and delayed replacement

**Pain**:
- Expected initially (resolves in weeks)
- Persistent pain: Infection, erosion, malposition

**Shortened Penis**:
- Corporal fibrosis reduces penile length
- Counsel preoperatively (often patient perception vs. measured change)

**Corporal Crossover/Perforation** (rare):
- Cylinder placed in wrong corpus
- Requires repositioning

## Other Male Reproductive Surgeries

- **Indications**: Peyronie's disease with curvature interfering with intercourse
- **Techniques**:
  - **Plication**: Shorten convex side (minimal ED, no incision in plaque)
  - **Plaque incision/excision with grafting**: Lengthen concave side (risk ED)
  - **Penile prosthesis**: If concomitant ED
- **Outcomes**: Straightening in 70-90%

## Microsurgical Sperm Retrieval

### Indications
- Azoospermia (absent sperm in ejaculate)
- Obstructive: Vasal/epididymal obstruction
- Non-obstructive: Testicular failure

### Techniques

**Testicular Sperm Extraction (TESE)**:
- Open testicular biopsy
- Multiple small tissue samples
- Success: 50-70% in non-obstructive azoospermia

**Microsurgical TESE (micro-TESE)**:
- Operate microscope to identify dilated seminiferous tubules
- Higher success in non-obstructive (50-70% vs. 30-50% conventional)
- Less testicular damage

**Percutaneous Sperm Aspiration**:
- Needle aspiration of testis or epididymis
- Office-based, less invasive
- Lower yield in non-obstructive

### Use with Assisted Reproduction
- Retrieved sperm used for intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI)
- Cryopreservation for future use
