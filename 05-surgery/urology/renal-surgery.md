# Renal Surgery

## Overview

Renal surgery encompasses procedures for kidney cancer, benign renal masses, traumatic injuries, renovascular disease, and congenital abnormalities. Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) represents the primary surgical indication, with approximately 76,000 new cases annually in the United States. Modern renal surgery emphasizes nephron-sparing approaches when feasible, utilizing minimally invasive techniques including laparoscopic and robotic-assisted surgery. The paradigm has shifted from open radical nephrectomy to partial nephrectomy for small renal masses, preserving renal function and improving long-term outcomes.

### Renal Anatomy
- **Gross anatomy**: Retroperitoneal organs at T12-L3 level
- **Blood supply**: Renal arteries (branch of aorta), renal veins (to IVC)
- **Arterial anatomy**: Segmental branches (apical, upper, middle, lower, posterior)
- **Venous anatomy**: Right renal vein short to IVC, left longer (receives left gonadal, adrenal veins)
- **Relations**: Surrounded by Gerota's fascia (perirenal fat and kidney)
- **Collecting system**: Calyces → renal pelvis → ureter

## Renal Cell Carcinoma

### Epidemiology
- **Incidence**: 76,000 new cases/year in US (3% of adult cancers)
- **Male predominance**: 2:1 ratio
- **Peak age**: 60-70 years
- **Mortality**: ~14,000 deaths/year
- **Survival**: 5-year survival 75% overall (stage-dependent: 93% localized, 70% regional, 13% distant)
- **Incidental detection**: 50-60% discovered incidentally on imaging

### Risk Factors
- **Smoking**: 2-fold increased risk
- **Obesity**: Strongest modifiable risk factor (especially in women)
- **Hypertension**: Independent risk factor
- **Chronic kidney disease**: Acquired cystic disease (dialysis patients)
- **Occupational**: Asbestos, cadmium, organic solvents
- **Genetic syndromes**: Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL), hereditary papillary RCC, Birt-Hogg-Dubé
- **Family history**: 2-4x risk with first-degree relative

### Pathology

**Histologic Subtypes**:
- **Clear cell RCC** (70-75%):
  - VHL gene mutations (chromosome 3p)
  - Best response to immunotherapy/targeted therapy
  - Most common metastatic subtype
- **Papillary RCC** (10-15%):
  - Type 1: Better prognosis
  - Type 2: More aggressive
  - MET proto-oncogene mutations
- **Chromophobe RCC** (5%):
  - Better prognosis than clear cell
  - Derived from intercalated cells of collecting duct
- **Collecting duct carcinoma** (<1%):
  - Aggressive, poor prognosis
  - Often presents at advanced stage
- **Medullary carcinoma** (<1%):
  - Associated with sickle cell trait
  - Extremely aggressive
- **Translocation RCC**: Pediatric and young adults
- **Unclassified RCC** (4-5%)

**Grading** (WHO/ISUP):
- Grade 1: Nucleoli invisible/small at 400x
- Grade 2: Nucleoli visible at 400x
- Grade 3: Nucleoli visible at 100x
- Grade 4: Extreme pleomorphism, sarcomatoid/rhabdoid features

**Prognostic Features**:
- Tumor grade (higher grade worse)
- Tumor necrosis (worse prognosis)
- Sarcomatoid differentiation (very poor prognosis)
- Microvascular invasion
- Collecting system invasion

### Clinical Presentation

**Classic Triad** (<10% present with all three):
- Hematuria (40-60%)
- Flank pain (40-50%)
- Palpable mass (25-45%)
- Classic triad: 10-15% (usually advanced disease)

**Paraneoplastic Syndromes** (30%):
- **Hypercalcemia**: PTHrP secretion (most common, 10-20%)
- **Erythrocytosis**: Erythropoietin secretion (3-10%)
- **Hypertension**: Renin secretion
- **Stauffer syndrome**: Non-metastatic hepatic dysfunction (reversible with nephrectomy)
- **Anemia**: Chronic disease, most common lab abnormality
- **Fever, weight loss, night sweats**: Systemic symptoms

**Metastatic Presentation** (25-30% at diagnosis):
- **Common sites**: Lung (45%), bone (30%), lymph nodes (22%), liver (20%), brain (8%)
- **Symptoms**: Cough, dyspnea, bone pain, neurological symptoms

**Incidental Finding** (50-60%):
- Asymptomatic, detected on imaging for other reasons
- Smaller tumors, better prognosis

### Diagnostic Evaluation

**Imaging**:

**Renal Mass Protocol CT** (Gold standard):
- Unenhanced, corticomedullary (arterial), nephrographic, excretory phases
- **Characteristics of RCC**:
  - Enhancement >15-20 Hounsfield units (distinguishes from cysts)
  - Heterogeneous enhancement
  - Necrosis, calcification in larger tumors
- Evaluate: Size, location, exophytic vs. endophytic, proximity to hilum, collecting system invasion
- Assess venous involvement (renal vein, IVC)
- Lymph nodes, adrenal glands, liver
- Bilateral kidneys (synchronous tumors 2-4%)

**MRI**:
- Alternative to CT (contrast allergy, renal insufficiency)
- Superior for venous involvement assessment (tumor thrombus)
- Characterize indeterminate lesions

**Ultrasound**:
- Initial detection (often incidental)
- Distinguish solid vs. cystic
- Limited staging capability

**Chest CT**:
- Evaluate for pulmonary metastases
- All patients with RCC diagnosis

**Bone Scan**:
- If elevated alkaline phosphatase, bone pain, or high-risk features

**Brain MRI**:
- If neurological symptoms or high-risk disease

**Renal Mass Biopsy**:
- **Not routine** if surgical management planned
- **Indications**:
  - Suspicion for lymphoma, metastasis, infection
  - Active surveillance planned
  - Ablative therapy considered
  - Metastatic disease (confirm histology before systemic therapy)
- **Accuracy**: 80-90% diagnostic yield
- **Complications**: Bleeding (rare), tumor seeding (extremely rare)

### Staging (TNM 8th Edition)

**T Stage**:
- **T1**: ≤7cm, limited to kidney
  - T1a: ≤4cm
  - T1b: >4cm but ≤7cm
- **T2**: >7cm, limited to kidney
  - T2a: >7cm but ≤10cm
  - T2b: >10cm
- **T3**: Extension into major veins or perinephric tissues, not beyond Gerota's fascia
  - T3a: Renal vein or perinephric fat
  - T3b: IVC below diaphragm
  - T3c: IVC above diaphragm or invading wall
- **T4**: Invades beyond Gerota's fascia (adrenal, adjacent organs)

**N Stage**:
- **N0**: No regional lymph node metastases
- **N1**: Regional lymph node metastases

**M Stage**:
- **M0**: No distant metastases
- **M1**: Distant metastases

**Stage Grouping**:
- Stage I: T1N0M0
- Stage II: T2N0M0
- Stage III: T3N0M0 or T1-3N1M0
- Stage IV: T4 any N M0 or any T any N M1

### Risk Stratification

**Small Renal Masses (<4cm)**:
- 20-30% are benign (oncocytoma, angiomyolipoma)
- 80% of malignant lesions are low-grade
- Metastatic potential increases with size

**RENAL Nephrometry Score**:
- (R)adius (tumor size)
- (E)xophytic/endophytic properties
- (N)earness to collecting system
- (A)nterior/posterior location
- (L)ocation relative to polar lines
- Predicts surgical complexity and complications

**Prognostic Models**:
- **UISS (UCLA Integrated Staging System)**: TNM, Fuhrman grade, ECOG
- **SSIGN (Stage, Size, Grade, Necrosis)**: Mayo Clinic model
- **Leibovich score**: Post-nephrectomy prognosis

## Treatment of Localized Renal Cell Carcinoma

### Active Surveillance

**Indications**:
- Small renal masses (<4cm)
- Elderly patients, significant comorbidities
- Limited life expectancy (<5 years)
- Patient preference

**Rationale**:
- Slow growth rate (median 0.3cm/year)
- Low metastatic potential for small masses
- Many patients die of competing causes

**Protocol**:
- Baseline imaging (CT or MRI)
- Follow-up imaging:
  - Every 3-6 months for year 1
  - Every 6-12 months years 2-5
  - Annually thereafter
- Intervention if: Rapid growth (>0.5cm/year), symptoms, size >4cm, patient preference

**Outcomes**:
- Metastasis rate: <1% for tumors <4cm on surveillance
- Growth rate: 0.1-0.4cm/year average
- 20-30% ultimately require intervention

### Partial Nephrectomy (Nephron-Sparing Surgery)

**Indications**:
- **Imperative**: Solitary kidney, bilateral tumors, hereditary RCC, CKD
- **Relative**: Normal contralateral kidney
- **Elective**: T1a tumors (<4cm) - preferred approach
- **Consideration**: T1b tumors (4-7cm) - increasingly performed

**Benefits**:
- Preservation of renal function
- Reduced risk of CKD and cardiovascular disease
- Oncologic outcomes equivalent to radical nephrectomy for T1 tumors
- Improved overall survival (due to preserved renal function)

**Approaches**:
- **Open**: Flank or anterior incision
- **Laparoscopic**: Minimally invasive
- **Robotic-assisted**: Most common, enhanced dexterity and 3D visualization

**Surgical Technique** (Robotic Partial Nephrectomy):

**Preoperative**:
- Review imaging (CT/MRI), plan approach
- Counsel on warm ischemia time goals (<25 minutes)
- Bowel preparation not routine

**Steps**:
1. **Port placement**: 5-6 trocars (transperitoneal or retroperitoneal approach)
2. **Colon mobilization**: Medialize colon
3. **Identify ureter**: Trace to hilum
4. **Mobilize kidney**: Expose Gerota's fascia
5. **Identify renal hilum**: Dissect renal artery and vein
6. **Expose tumor**: Open Gerota's fascia, identify tumor
7. **Score resection margin**: Electrocautery around tumor (0.5-1cm margin)
8. **Hilar clamping** (for larger/complex tumors):
   - Bulldog clamps on renal artery (± vein)
   - Start warm ischemia timer
9. **Tumor excision**: Sharp dissection, remove tumor with margin
10. **Collecting system closure**: Suture any entry with absorbable suture
11. **Hemostasis**: Argon beam coagulation, hemostatic agents
12. **Renorrhaphy**: Running or interrupted sutures over bolsters to close defect
13. **Unclamp**: Release hilar clamps
14. **Check hemostasis**: Ensure no bleeding
15. **Send tumor**: Orient for pathology
16. **Drain placement**: Closed-suction drain

**Warm Ischemia Time**:
- Goal: <25 minutes (reduces risk of AKI)
- Zero ischemia techniques: For exophytic tumors, no clamping
- Selective clamping: Segmental artery clamping

**Postoperative Care**:
- Hospital stay: 2-3 days (robotic/laparoscopic), 4-5 days (open)
- Foley catheter: Remove POD 1
- Drain: Monitor output, remove when <30mL/day or POD 3-5
  - High output (>50-100mL/day) suggests urine leak
- Diet: Advance as tolerated
- Activity: Early ambulation, avoid heavy lifting 4-6 weeks
- Labs: BUN/Cr on POD 1 (expect transient rise)
- Follow-up: 6 weeks with repeat imaging (CT/MRI)

**Outcomes**:
- **Oncologic**: 5-year cancer-specific survival >95% for T1a
- **Functional**: Median GFR decline 10-20% (vs. 25-40% with radical nephrectomy)
- **Positive margins**: 5-7% (often not clinically significant if focal)
- **Recurrence**: Local recurrence <5%

**Complications**:
- **Bleeding** (3-5%):
  - Minor: Observation
  - Significant: Transfusion, angioembolization, re-exploration
- **Urinary leak/fistula** (5-10%):
  - Most resolve with prolonged drainage
  - Ureteral stent if collecting system injury
- **Acute kidney injury**: Transient in most cases
- **Pseudoaneurysm**: Late complication (weeks), presents with hematuria
  - Angioembolization
- **Conversion to radical nephrectomy**: <5%
- **Abscess/infection**: <2%

### Radical Nephrectomy

**Indications**:
- T2-T4 tumors (>7cm or locally advanced)
- T1 tumors not amenable to partial nephrectomy
- Central tumors involving hilum
- Multiple tumors
- Metastatic disease with symptoms (bleeding, pain)

**Technique** (Open or Laparoscopic/Robotic):

**Open Approach**:
1. **Incision**: Flank (11th or 12th rib), subcostal, or midline
2. **Colon mobilization**: Medialize colon
3. **Gerota's fascia**: Identify and incise
4. **Early hilar control**: Isolate and ligate renal artery, then vein
5. **En bloc resection**: Remove kidney with Gerota's fascia, perirenal fat, adrenal (if involved)
6. **Lymphadenectomy**: If clinically enlarged nodes
7. **Hemostasis**: Ensure no bleeding
8. **Drain placement**
9. **Closure**: Layer closure

**Laparoscopic/Robotic**:
- Smaller incisions, faster recovery
- Oncologic outcomes equivalent to open
- Increased operative time
- Similar complication rates

**IVC Tumor Thrombus**:
- Present in 4-10% of RCC
- **Level 0**: Renal vein only
- **Level I**: IVC <2cm from renal vein
- **Level II**: IVC >2cm from vein but below hepatic veins
- **Level III**: IVC above hepatic veins but below diaphragm
- **Level IV**: Above diaphragm or into right atrium
- **Surgery**:
  - Levels 0-II: Urologic surgery ± vascular surgery
  - Levels III-IV: Multidisciplinary (urology, vascular, cardiac surgery)
  - Cardiopulmonary bypass for level IV
- **Outcomes**: 5-year survival 40-65% if non-metastatic

**Lymphadenectomy**:
- Not routinely performed (no survival benefit in absence of clinically enlarged nodes)
- Perform if enlarged nodes on imaging or intraoperatively

**Adrenalectomy**:
- Not routine (involved in <5%)
- Perform if: Upper pole tumors, large tumors, imaging suggests involvement

**Postoperative Care**:
- Hospital stay: 3-5 days (open), 1-3 days (laparoscopic/robotic)
- Pain control
- Early ambulation
- Drain management
- Monitor renal function

**Outcomes**:
- 5-year cancer-specific survival:
  - T1: 95%
  - T2: 80-90%
  - T3: 60-70%
  - T4: 20-35%
- Overall survival lower (competing causes in elderly population)

**Complications**:
- Bleeding, infection, ileus (similar to partial nephrectomy)
- Injury to adjacent organs (spleen, pancreas, liver, bowel)
- Pneumothorax (flank approach)
- Chronic kidney disease progression (solitary kidney dependence)

### Ablative Therapies

**Indications**:
- Small renal masses (<3cm ideal)
- Poor surgical candidates
- Hereditary RCC (multiple tumors)
- Patient preference

**Cryoablation**:
- Freeze tumor to -40°C, ice ball formation
- Percutaneous (CT or ultrasound-guided) or laparoscopic
- **Advantages**: Office-based possible, good visualization of ice ball
- **Disadvantages**: Hemorrhage risk (ice ball fracture)

**Radiofrequency Ablation (RFA)**:
- Heat tumor to >60°C
- Percutaneous or laparoscopic
- **Advantages**: Lower complication rate
- **Disadvantages**: Heat sink effect (adjacent vessels cool tumor), less visibility

**Microwave Ablation**:
- Similar to RFA, higher temperatures
- Less affected by heat sink

**Outcomes**:
- Local recurrence-free survival: 85-95% at 5 years (for tumors <3cm)
- Higher recurrence rates than surgery
- Cancer-specific survival >95% for small tumors

**Complications**:
- Pain, hematuria (common)
- Bleeding, urinoma (5-10%)
- Injury to adjacent organs (colon, ureter)
- Incomplete ablation (5-10%)

## Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma

### Cytoreductive Nephrectomy

**Rationale** (historical):
- Remove primary tumor before immunotherapy
- Reduce tumor burden
- CARMENA trial (2018): Questioned benefit in era of targeted therapy

**Current Indications** (select patients):
- Good performance status (ECOG 0-1)
- Predominantly clear cell histology
- Limited metastatic burden
- Symptomatic primary (bleeding, pain)
- Planning cytokine-based therapy

**Avoid if**:
- Poor performance status (ECOG >1)
- Brain metastases
- Extensive metastatic disease
- Sarcomatoid histology
- More harm than benefit from surgery

### Metastasectomy

**Indications**:
- Solitary or oligometastatic disease
- Disease-free interval >1 year
- Complete resection achievable
- Good performance status

**Sites**: Lung (most common), brain, bone, adrenal

**Outcomes**:
- 5-year survival 35-50% after complete metastasectomy
- Better outcomes with longer disease-free interval

### Systemic Therapy

**Targeted Therapy** (clear cell RCC):

**VEGF Pathway Inhibitors**:
- **Sunitinib, pazopanib, cabozantinib**: Tyrosine kinase inhibitors
- **Bevacizumab** (+ interferon): VEGF antibody
- First-line options

**mTOR Inhibitors**:
- **Temsirolimus, everolimus**
- First-line (poor-risk) or second-line

**Combination Therapy**:
- **Lenvatinib + pembrolizumab**
- **Cabozantinib + nivolumab**
- **Axitinib + pembrolizumab or avelumab**
- Superior outcomes to single-agent therapy

**Immunotherapy**:

**Checkpoint Inhibitors**:
- **Nivolumab + ipilimumab**: First-line for intermediate/poor-risk
- **Pembrolizumab**: Combination regimens

**Response Rates**:
- Combination therapy: 40-60% objective response
- Median PFS: 15-24 months
- Median OS: 30-50 months

**Treatment Sequence**:
- Typically progress through multiple lines
- No established optimal sequence

**Non-Clear Cell RCC**:
- Less responsive to VEGF inhibitors
- Immunotherapy emerging
- Clinical trials encouraged

## Benign Renal Masses

### Oncocytoma
- **Incidence**: 5-10% of resected renal masses
- **Characteristics**: Benign, well-circumscribed, mahogany-brown
- **Imaging**: Cannot reliably distinguish from RCC
- **Central scar**: Classic but not specific
- **Management**: Surgical excision or biopsy-proven observation

### Angiomyolipoma (AML)
- **Composition**: Fat, smooth muscle, blood vessels
- **Associations**: Tuberous sclerosis (20%), sporadic (80%)
- **Imaging**: Fat-containing lesion (diagnostic on CT/MRI)
- **Symptoms**: Usually asymptomatic; risk of hemorrhage if >4cm
- **Management**:
  - <4cm: Observation
  - >4cm: Consider prophylactic embolization or partial nephrectomy (bleeding risk)
  - Symptomatic: Emergent embolization or surgery

### Simple Renal Cysts
- **Prevalence**: 40-50% of adults >50 years
- **Bosniak Classification**:
  - **I**: Simple cyst (thin wall, no septations, no enhancement) - benign
  - **II**: Minimally complex (thin septations, fine calcification) - benign
  - **IIF**: Follow-up needed (slightly thickened wall, more septations) - 5% cancer risk
  - **III**: Indeterminate (thick/irregular wall, enhancement) - 50% cancer risk
  - **IV**: Clearly malignant (solid enhancing components) - 90% cancer risk
- **Management**:
  - I, II: No follow-up
  - IIF: Imaging surveillance
  - III, IV: Surgical excision

## Other Renal Surgical Conditions

### Renal Trauma
- **Grading** (AAST):
  - Grade I: Contusion, non-expanding hematoma
  - Grade II: <1cm laceration, no extravasation
  - Grade III: >1cm laceration, no collecting system injury
  - Grade IV: Laceration with collecting system injury or vascular injury (segmental artery/vein)
  - Grade V: Shattered kidney or renal pedicle injury
- **Management**:
  - Grades I-III: Usually conservative (bedrest, observation)
  - Grade IV: Urine extravasation may need ureteral stent or nephrostomy
  - Grade V: Surgical exploration, often nephrectomy
  - Stable hemodynamics: Conservative management preferred

### Renovascular Hypertension
- Renal artery stenosis causing hypertension
- **Causes**: Atherosclerosis (90%), fibromuscular dysplasia (10%)
- **Diagnosis**: Renal artery duplex, CTA, MRA
- **Management**: Angioplasty ± stent, surgical bypass (rare)

### Ureteropelvic Junction (UPJ) Obstruction
- Intrinsic or extrinsic obstruction at UPJ
- **Presentation**: Flank pain, hydronephrosis
- **Diagnosis**: Renal ultrasound, MAG-3 renal scan
- **Management**: Pyeloplasty (open, laparoscopic, robotic)

## Surveillance After Treatment

### Post-Partial or Radical Nephrectomy

**Imaging Schedule** (based on stage):
- **Low-risk (T1a)**: CT chest/abdomen/pelvis at 6 months, then annually for 3 years
- **Intermediate-risk (T1b, T2)**: Baseline, then every 6 months for 3 years, then annually to year 5
- **High-risk (T3, T4, N+)**: Baseline, every 3-6 months for 3 years, then annually to year 10

**Laboratory**:
- BUN, creatinine, eGFR at each visit
- CBC, LFTs, alkaline phosphatase

**Clinical Assessment**:
- Symptoms of recurrence
- Performance status
- Renal function monitoring
