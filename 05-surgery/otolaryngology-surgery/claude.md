# Otolaryngology Surgery (ENT)

## Overview

Otolaryngology surgery encompasses procedures of the head and neck, including the ears, nose, throat, and related structures. ENT surgeons manage both benign and malignant conditions affecting these anatomically complex regions. Modern ENT surgery emphasizes minimally invasive endoscopic techniques, functional preservation, and oncologic principles when treating malignancies.

**Content Status**: Comprehensive ENT surgical coverage
**Quality Features**: Endoscopic techniques, oncologic surgery, airway management
