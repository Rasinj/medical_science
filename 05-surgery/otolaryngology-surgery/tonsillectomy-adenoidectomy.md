# Tonsillectomy and Adenoidectomy

## Overview

Tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy are among the most common surgical procedures performed in children and adults. These procedures remove lymphoid tissue from the oropharynx (palatine tonsils) and nasopharynx (adenoids) for infectious or obstructive indications. Despite their frequency, these surgeries require careful patient selection, meticulous technique, and vigilant postoperative management to minimize complications, particularly hemorrhage. Modern approaches emphasize evidence-based indications and techniques that balance efficacy with minimal morbidity.

## Anatomy and Physiology

### Palatine Tonsils

**Location**:
- Oropharynx, between anterior (palatoglossus) and posterior (palatopharyngeus) tonsillar pillars
- Tonsillar fossa laterally

**Structure**:
- Lymphoid tissue with crypts (10-30 deep invaginations)
- Covered by stratified squamous epithelium
- **Size grading** (Brodsky scale):
  - 0: Surgically absent
  - 1: <25% oropharyngeal space
  - 2: 25-50% oropharyngeal space
  - 3: 50-75% oropharyngeal space
  - 4: >75% oropharyngeal space (kissing tonsils)

**Blood Supply**:
- **Tonsillar artery**: Branch of facial artery (inferiorly)
- **Ascending pharyngeal artery**: Posteriorly
- **Lesser palatine artery**: Superiorly
- **Dorsal lingual artery**: Anteroinferiorly
- Rich anastomotic network

**Innervation**:
- Glossopharyngeal nerve (CN IX)
- Lesser palatine nerve (CN V2)

**Function**:
- Part of Waldeyer's ring (immunologic tissue)
- Antigen sampling, B-cell production
- Most active in childhood (peak size 3-7 years), involute in adolescence

### Adenoids

**Location**:
- Nasopharynx, posterior wall and roof
- Superior to soft palate, posterior to choanae

**Structure**:
- Lymphoid tissue covered by ciliated respiratory epithelium
- No crypts (unlike tonsils)
- **Size grading**: % of nasopharyngeal airway obstruction (lateral neck X-ray or nasal endoscopy)
  - Grade 1: <25%
  - Grade 2: 25-50%
  - Grade 3: 50-75%
  - Grade 4: >75% (choanal obstruction)

**Blood Supply**:
- Ascending pharyngeal artery
- Pharyngeal branch of internal maxillary artery

**Function**:
- Immune surveillance (like tonsils)
- Peak size 3-5 years, usually involute by adolescence

### Related Anatomy

**Tonsillar Fossa**:
- **Lateral wall**: Superior constrictor muscle, palatopharyngeus muscle
- **Deep to muscle**: Glossopharyngeal nerve, internal carotid artery (2-2.5cm lateral)
- **Inferior pole**: Close to lingual artery

**Nasopharynx**:
- **Eustachian tube orifice (torus tubarius)**: Lateral wall, 1cm from adenoid (injury can cause otitis)
- **Prevertebral fascia**: Posterior, overlying C1-C2 vertebrae
- **Internal carotid artery**: Lateral (rarely, tortuosity can bring close to midline)

## Indications for Surgery

### Tonsillectomy

**Absolute Indications**:
- **Recurrent acute tonsillitis** (Paradise criteria):
  - ≥7 episodes in 1 year, OR
  - ≥5 episodes per year for 2 years, OR
  - ≥3 episodes per year for 3 years
  - **Each episode**: Sore throat PLUS one of: Temperature >38.3°C, cervical adenopathy, tonsillar exudate, positive GAS culture
- **Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)** due to tonsillar hypertrophy:
  - Polysomnography-confirmed OSA (AHI ≥5)
  - Clinical findings: Snoring, witnessed apneas, daytime somnolence, failure to thrive
- **Peritonsillar abscess** (controversial):
  - Recurrent abscesses (after ≥2 episodes)
  - First episode with severe symptoms or poor response to drainage
- **Suspicion of malignancy**:
  - Unilateral tonsillar enlargement
  - Concerning features (firm, fixed, ulceration)
  - Tonsillar biopsy for diagnosis

**Relative Indications**:
- **Chronic tonsillitis**: Persistent symptoms despite medical therapy
- **Tonsillar hyperplasia**: Causing dysphagia, speech abnormality (muffled "hot potato" voice), dental malocclusion
- **Halitosis**: From chronic tonsillitis, tonsilloliths

- **Psoriatic arthritis/guttate psoriasis**: Associated with streptococcal tonsillitis (controversial)
- **IgA nephropathy**: Tonsillar focus of infection (controversial)

### Adenoidectomy

**Indications**:
- **Nasal obstruction**: Mouth breathing, snoring, hyponasal speech
- **Obstructive sleep apnea**: Adenoid hypertrophy contribution
- **Recurrent/chronic rhinosinusitis**: Adenoids as bacterial reservoir
- **Chronic otitis media with effusion**:
  - Persistent effusion >3 months with hearing loss
  - Recurrent acute otitis media (≥3 in 6 months, ≥4 in 12 months)
  - Adenoidectomy adjunct to tympanostomy tubes (especially revision tubes)
- **Chronic adenoiditis**: Persistent nasal discharge, postnasal drip
- **Eustachian tube dysfunction**: Contributing to middle ear disease

**Contraindications to Adenoidectomy**:
- **Submucous cleft palate** or **short palate**: Risk of velopharyngeal insufficiency (VPI)
  - Screen for bifid uvula, palpate palate
- **Neuromuscular disorder** affecting palatal function

### Combined Tonsillectomy and Adenoidectomy (T&A)

**Indications**: When indications for both present, especially:
- **Obstructive sleep apnea**: Both tonsil and adenoid hypertrophy
- Children with recurrent tonsillitis AND otitis media/rhinosinusitis

## Preoperative Assessment

### Clinical Evaluation

**History**:
- **Infectious**: Frequency and severity of tonsillitis episodes, antibiotic use, missed school/work
- **Obstructive**: Snoring, witnessed apneas, restless sleep, daytime sleepiness, enuresis, hyperactivity, poor growth
- **OSA symptoms**: Epworth Sleepiness Scale, BEARS sleep questionnaire (children)
- **Prior peritonsillar abscess**: Number, drainage required
- **Bleeding history**: Prior excessive bleeding, easy bruising, family history of bleeding disorders
- **Medications**: Anticoagulants, NSAIDs (hold 7-10 days preoperatively)
- **Medical history**: Cardiac disease, bleeding disorders, immunodeficiency

**Physical Examination**:
- **Oropharynx**: Tonsil size (Brodsky grade), exudate, asymmetry (concern for malignancy), palatal anatomy
- **Nasopharynx**: Nasal endoscopy to assess adenoid size, rule out masses
- **Neck**: Lymphadenopathy
- **Palate**: Assess for submucous cleft (bifid uvula, translucent midline, palpable notch in posterior hard palate)

### Investigations

**Sleep Study** (polysomnography):
- **Indications**: Clinical suspicion of OSA (especially if <3 years, obesity, craniofacial abnormalities, Down syndrome, neuromuscular disorders)
- **AHI (Apnea-Hypopnea Index)**: ≥5 abnormal in children
- **Oxygen desaturation**: Severity marker
- Not required for all cases (clinical diagnosis often sufficient)

**Laboratory**:
- **CBC**: Not routine, if concern for anemia, infection
- **Coagulation studies** (PT/PTT): NOT routinely indicated (not predictive)
  - Indicated only if: Personal or family bleeding history, liver disease, anticoagulation
- **Monospot/EBV serology**: If acute mononucleosis suspected (delay surgery 3-4 weeks if positive - bleeding risk)

**Imaging**: Not routinely required
- **Lateral neck X-ray**: Adenoid size (if endoscopy not performed)
- **CT/MRI**: If concern for malignancy, retropharyngeal abscess

### Consent

**Risks**:
- **Common**: Sore throat (7-10 days), otalgia (referred pain), voice changes (temporary), bad breath
- **Bleeding**:
  - **Primary** (within 24 hours): 0.5-1%
  - **Secondary** (POD 5-10): 2-4%
  - May require return to OR for control
- **Infection**: Very rare
- **Velopharyngeal insufficiency**: 1/1500-10,000 (hypernasal speech, nasal regurgitation)
- **Anesthesia risks**: Aspiration, dental injury, intubation trauma
- **Death**: Exceedingly rare (1/10,000-50,000)

**Benefits**: Reduction in throat infections, improvement in OSA, improved quality of life

## Surgical Techniques

### Anesthesia

- **General anesthesia**: Required (endotracheal intubation)
- **Positioning**: Supine, neck extended, mouth gag (McIvor, Crowe-Davis) for exposure
- **IV dexamethasone** (0.5mg/kg, max 8-10mg): Reduces nausea, pain, swelling
- **IV antibiotics**: Single perioperative dose (controversial, some evidence for reduced secondary bleeding)

### Tonsillectomy Techniques

Multiple techniques available; choice based on surgeon preference, patient factors, bleeding risk

**1. Cold Dissection (Cold Steel)**:
- **Technique**: Dissection in peritonsillar space with knife or scissors, remove tonsil en bloc, electrocautery for hemostasis
- **Advantages**: Complete removal, minimal thermal injury to surrounding tissue, less postoperative pain (some studies)
- **Disadvantages**: More intraoperative bleeding, longer operative time
- **Most common traditional method**

**2. Electrocautery (Hot Dissection)**:
- **Technique**: Monopolar or bipolar cautery for dissection and hemostasis simultaneously
- **Advantages**: Less intraoperative bleeding, faster
- **Disadvantages**: More thermal injury, potentially more postoperative pain (controversial)

**3. Coblation (Radiofrequency Ablation)**:
- **Technique**: Bipolar radiofrequency energy creates plasma field, dissects tissue at lower temperatures (40-70°C vs 400°C for cautery)
- **Advantages**: Less thermal damage, potentially less pain and faster recovery (data mixed)
- **Disadvantages**: Higher cost, secondary bleeding rates similar or higher in some studies

**4. Harmonic Scalpel (Ultrasonic)**:
- **Technique**: Ultrasonic vibration cuts and coagulates
- **Advantages**: Minimal thermal spread, less pain (some studies)
- **Disadvantages**: Cost, secondary bleeding rates vary

**5. Laser Tonsillectomy**:
- **Technique**: CO2 or KTP laser for dissection
- **Advantages**: Precise, less bleeding
- **Disadvantages**: Expensive, smoke plume, specialized training

**Current Evidence**: No single technique clearly superior for all outcomes. Cold dissection may have less postoperative pain; electrocautery faster with less intraoperative bleeding. Secondary bleeding rates similar across techniques.

### Tonsillectomy Steps

**1. Exposure**:
- Mouth gag placement (protect teeth with guard)
- Identify tonsils, anterior and posterior pillars

**2. Infiltration** (optional):
- Local anesthetic with epinephrine (1% lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine)
- Injected into anterior pillar, peritonsillar space
- Reduces bleeding, provides postoperative analgesia

**3. Incision**:
- Incise anterior pillar, mucosa along superior pole

**4. Dissection**:
- **Plane**: Between tonsillar capsule and superior constrictor muscle
- Dissect superiorly to inferiorly (or vice versa)
- Stay in correct plane (too superficial - capsule tears, bleeding; too deep - muscle injury)

**5. Inferior pole release**:
- Most vascular area, carefully ligate/cauterize
- Completely remove tonsil (no remnants)

**6. Hemostasis**:
- Inspect fossa carefully
- Cautery (bipolar preferred - less thermal spread), ties, packing if needed
- Ensure complete hemostasis before removing gag

**7. Repeat contralateral side**

### Intracapsular Tonsillectomy (Tonsillotomy)

**Technique**: Partial tonsil removal (subtotal tonsillectomy), leave capsule intact
- Microdebrider, coblation, or laser
- Remove obstructive tissue, leave thin rim of tonsil and capsule

**Advantages**: Less pain, faster recovery, lower bleeding risk
**Disadvantages**: Regrowth possible, not appropriate for recurrent tonsillitis (infectious indications)
**Indications**: Obstructive symptoms only (OSA)

### Adenoidectomy Techniques

**1. Adenoid Curette**:
- **Technique**: Traditional method, curved curette scrapes adenoid tissue from nasopharynx
- Palpate with finger to confirm complete removal
- **Disadvantages**: Blind technique, incomplete removal, bleeding

**2. Adenoid Microdebrider (Power-Assisted)**:
- **Technique**: Endoscopic visualization, microdebrider removes adenoid tissue under direct vision
- **Advantages**: Complete removal, visualization of nasopharynx (eustachian tubes, choanae), less bleeding
- **Disadvantages**: Longer operative time, cost
- **Preferred by many surgeons**

**3. Electrocautery**:
- Monopolar or bipolar suction cautery
- Direct visualization (mirror or endoscope)

**4. Coblation**:
- Radiofrequency ablation under endoscopic guidance

### Adenoidectomy Steps

**1. Exposure**:
- Mouth gag with palate retraction (red rubber catheter through nose, pull soft palate anteriorly)
- Allows visualization of nasopharynx

**2. Assessment**:
- Endoscopy or mirror to assess adenoid size, location

**3. Removal**:
- **Curette method**: Curette from superior to inferior, sweeping motion
- **Microdebrider**: Under endoscopic vision, systematically remove adenoid tissue from nasopharyngeal roof and posterior wall
- Avoid lateral nasopharynx (eustachian tube orifice)

**4. Hemostasis**:
- Packing with epinephrine-soaked gauze
- Suction cautery for bleeding points
- Usually less bleeding than tonsillectomy

**5. Inspection**:
- Confirm complete removal, no residual tissue
- Ensure no injury to eustachian tube orifices, soft palate

## Postoperative Management

### Immediate Postoperative

**Recovery Room**:
- Monitor for bleeding (frequent swallowing, blood in mouth)
- Vital signs, oxygen saturation
- **High risk for airway obstruction**: Young children (<3 years), severe OSA, obesity, craniofacial abnormalities, Down syndrome
  - May require ICU monitoring overnight

**Discharge Criteria**:
- Adequate oral intake (tolerating liquids)
- No bleeding
- Adequate pain control
- Stable vital signs
- Usually same-day discharge (outpatient)
- **Admission considerations**: Age <3 years, severe OSA (AHI >10), comorbidities, poor oral intake, bleeding

### Pain Management

**Multimodal Approach**:
- **Acetaminophen**: First-line (scheduled dosing, not PRN)
- **Opioids**: Codeine NO LONGER RECOMMENDED (FDA black box warning - respiratory depression, deaths in children)
  - Alternative opioids: Oxycodone, hydrocodone (use cautiously, lowest dose, shortest duration)
  - Particularly avoid in children with OSA (respiratory depression risk)
- **NSAIDs**: Controversial (bleeding risk)
  - Ibuprofen: Some studies show safe, effective; others show increased bleeding
  - Generally avoided in first 24 hours; use cautiously thereafter
- **Local anesthetic**: Infiltration at time of surgery
- **Steroids**: Dexamethasone (intraoperative) reduces pain, nausea

**Pain expected**: 7-10 days, peaks POD 3-5

### Diet and Activity

**Diet**:
- **Early**: Start with cool liquids (avoid red/orange colors - mimic blood)
- **Advance**: Soft foods as tolerated (ice cream, popsicles, mashed potatoes, pasta)
- **Avoid**: Hot, spicy, acidic, crunchy foods (increase pain, bleeding risk)
- **Hydration**: CRITICAL - reduces pain, prevents dehydration
  - Goal: Maintain urine output (light yellow urine)

**Activity**:
- Rest for 1-2 weeks
- Avoid strenuous activity, heavy lifting, contact sports for 2 weeks (bleeding risk)
- No swimming for 2 weeks
- School/work: Return when pain controlled, tolerating diet (usually 7-10 days)

### Medications

**Antibiotics**: NOT routinely indicated (controversial)
- May reduce secondary bleeding risk (some studies)
- If used: Amoxicillin or amoxicillin-clavulanate for 7-10 days

**Oral care**: Gentle brushing, avoid vigorous gargling

### Follow-Up

**Routine**: 2-3 weeks postoperatively
- Assess healing, pain, complications
- Repeat sleep study if OSA (at least 6-8 weeks post-op to assess resolution)

**Contact indications**: Bleeding (more than small streaks), dehydration, severe pain, fever >38.5°C

## Complications

### Hemorrhage

**Most serious complication**

**Primary Hemorrhage** (within 24 hours):
- Incidence: 0.5-1%
- **Cause**: Inadequate intraoperative hemostasis
- **Management**:
  - Admit, IV access, NPO
  - Assess severity (vital signs, amount)
  - Minor: Observation
  - Major: Return to OR for examination, hemostasis (cautery, ligation, packing)

**Secondary Hemorrhage** (POD 5-10, peak POD 7):
- Incidence: 2-4% (higher in adolescents, adults)
- **Cause**: Eschar separation from tonsillar fossa
- **Risk factors**: Inadequate pain control (decreased PO intake, dehydration), excessive activity, infection, cautery use (controversial)
- **Presentation**: Blood-streaked saliva (minor) to active bleeding
- **Management**:
  - **Minor bleeding** (streaks, stopped): Observation, hydration, gargle with ice water, topical tranexamic acid
  - **Moderate/severe bleeding**: Admit, IV access, NPO, crossmatch blood
    - Examination in OR: May see clot in fossa, remove clot, cauterize bleeding vessels
    - If no active bleeding: Observation vs. cauterization of fossa
    - Active bleeding: Cautery, ligation, rarely packing or vessel ligation

**Patient instructions**: Seek emergency care if:
- Bright red blood from mouth (more than streaks)
- Continuous spitting of blood
- Vomiting blood

### Dehydration

- Common (inadequate oral intake due to pain)
- **Presentation**: Decreased urine output, dry mucous membranes, lethargy, fever
- **Management**: Encourage PO fluids, IV hydration if severe, admission if unable to maintain hydration
- **Prevention**: Adequate pain control (allows drinking)

### Infection

- Rare (oropharyngeal flora)
- **Presentation**: Fever, worsening pain, purulent exudate
- **Management**: Antibiotics (usually not needed)

### Velopharyngeal Insufficiency (VPI)

- **Incidence**: 1/1,500-10,000
- **Cause**: Excessive removal of adenoid tissue, scarring of soft palate
- **Presentation**: Hypernasal speech, nasal regurgitation of liquids
- **Risk factors**: Submucous cleft palate, short palate, neuromuscular disorders
- **Management**: Speech therapy, rarely surgical correction (pharyngeal flap, sphincter pharyngoplasty)

### Other Complications

**Airway Obstruction**:
- Edema, laryngospasm, aspiration
- Higher risk: Young children, severe OSA
- Management: Close monitoring, corticosteroids, rarely reintubation

**Otalgia**:
- Referred pain via glossopharyngeal nerve
- Very common, peaks POD 3-5
- Management: Pain control (same as throat pain)

**Taste Changes**:
- Temporary, usually resolves
- Rarely permanent (glossopharyngeal nerve injury)

**Uvular Edema**:
- From mouth gag trauma
- Usually resolves spontaneously

**Dental Injury**:
- From mouth gag
- Prevention: Teeth guards

**Atlantoaxial Subluxation (Grisel Syndrome)**:
- Rare, rotatory subluxation of C1-C2
- **Presentation**: Torticollis, neck pain 1-2 weeks post-op
- **Cause**: Inflammation spreading to atlantoaxial ligaments
- **Management**: Immobilization, antibiotics, rarely surgery

## Outcomes

### Efficacy

**Recurrent Tonsillitis**:
- **Reduction in episodes**: 1-2 fewer episodes per year in years 1-2 post-surgery (Paradise studies)
- **Modest benefit**: Many children improve without surgery (natural history)
- **Selection**: Greatest benefit in patients meeting Paradise criteria

**Obstructive Sleep Apnea**:
- **Resolution**: 70-90% of children with OSA improve
- **Cure rate**: 27-79% (variable definitions)
- **Residual OSA**: Higher risk in obese children, severe baseline OSA, older age
- **Follow-up PSG**: Recommended for high-risk groups to confirm resolution

**Quality of Life**:
- Significant improvement in behavior, school performance, growth (OSA)
- Reduced missed school/work (recurrent tonsillitis)
- Improved sleep for entire family

### Recurrence

**Tonsillar Regrowth**:
- Rare after complete tonsillectomy (<1%)
- More common after intracapsular tonsillectomy (10-20%)

**Adenoid Regrowth**:
- 10-20% (more common in young children)
- May require revision adenoidectomy if symptomatic

## Special Populations

### Young Children (<3 years)

**Increased risks**: Airway obstruction, dehydration, respiratory complications
**Overnight observation**: Recommended for age <3, especially if OSA

### Adolescents and Adults

**Differences from children**:
- More postoperative pain
- Longer recovery (2-3 weeks)
- Higher bleeding risk
- More cautery-related complications (scarring)

### Down Syndrome

**Higher OSA prevalence**: Anatomic factors (midface hypoplasia, macroglossia)
**Increased risks**: Atlantoaxial instability (C-spine imaging preoperatively), airway obstruction post-op
**Cure rate lower**: Multilevel obstruction (consider tongue reduction, supraglottoplasty)

### Bleeding Disorders

**Evaluation**: Hematology consultation, factor replacement if needed
**Technique**: Meticulous hemostasis, consider cold steel technique, hospital admission post-op

## Alternatives and Adjuncts

**Watchful Waiting**:
- Appropriate if symptoms mild, not meeting surgical criteria
- Natural resolution common (especially in young children)

**Medical Management**:
- **Recurrent tonsillitis**: Prophylactic antibiotics (limited benefit, resistance concerns)
- **OSA**: Weight loss (if obese), nasal steroids (adenoid hypertrophy), myofunctional therapy
- **PFAPA**: Colchicine, cimetidine

**Partial Intracapsular Tonsillectomy**:
- For obstructive symptoms only
- Less morbidity, faster recovery

## Key Points

- Tonsillectomy indicated for recurrent tonsillitis (Paradise criteria) or OSA; adenoidectomy for nasal obstruction, recurrent OM/sinusitis, or OSA
- Most common in children ages 3-8 years; natural involution of tonsils/adenoids often occurs
- Multiple surgical techniques available; no single technique clearly superior, though cold dissection may reduce postoperative pain
- Postoperative hemorrhage most serious complication: primary (0.5-1%) within 24 hours, secondary (2-4%) POD 5-10
- Pain management critical: acetaminophen first-line, avoid codeine (FDA black box warning in children), NSAIDs controversial
- Adequate hydration essential: reduces pain, prevents dehydration (common complication)
- T&A cures OSA in 70-90% of children, but lower in obese and those with severe baseline OSA
- Tonsillectomy reduces throat infections modestly in first 1-2 years (1-2 fewer episodes) in those meeting Paradise criteria
- Young children (<3 years) and those with severe OSA require overnight observation due to airway obstruction risk
- Velopharyngeal insufficiency rare (1/1,500-10,000) but serious; screen for submucous cleft palate preoperatively
- Adenoid regrowth occurs in 10-20%, more common in young children; may require revision
- Intracapsular tonsillectomy (tonsillotomy) emerging alternative for OSA with less pain, faster recovery, but not for infectious indications
