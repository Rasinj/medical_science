# Airway Surgery

## Overview

Airway surgery encompasses procedures to establish, maintain, or restore patency of the upper airway. Tracheostomy, the creation of a surgical airway through the anterior neck into the trachea, represents one of the oldest and most commonly performed procedures in otolaryngology and critical care. Modern airway surgery also includes management of laryngotracheal stenosis, complex airway reconstruction, and emergency airway procedures. Successful outcomes require thorough anatomic knowledge, careful patient selection, meticulous technique, and comprehensive postoperative care.

## Anatomy

### Laryngeal Framework

**Cartilages**:
- **Thyroid cartilage**: Largest, "Adam's apple," V-shaped, provides anterior laryngeal protection
- **Cricoid cartilage**: Only complete cartilaginous ring in airway, below thyroid
  - Narrowest part of pediatric airway (subglottis)
  - Cricothyroid membrane superiorly (emergency airway access)
- **Arytenoid cartilages**: Paired, posterior, vocal cord attachment, mobile
- **Epiglottis**: Leaf-shaped, protects airway during swallowing

**Muscles**:
- **Intrinsic laryngeal muscles**: All innervated by recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) except cricothyroid (external branch superior laryngeal nerve)
  - **Posterior cricoarytenoid**: ONLY abductor (opens airway)
  - Others: Adductors, tensors
- **Bilateral RLN injury**: Both vocal cords paramedian → airway obstruction

**Vocal Cords**:
- **True vocal cords**: Glottis, voice production
- **False vocal cords**: Superior to true cords, supraglottis

### Trachea

**Structure**:
- **Length**: Adults 10-13cm (10-12 tracheal rings)
- **Diameter**: 1.5-2cm
- **Rings**: C-shaped cartilaginous rings (16-20 total), open posteriorly
- **Posterior membrane**: Membranous trachea (esophagus lies posterior)

**Relations**:
- **Anterior**: Skin, subcutaneous tissue, strap muscles (sternohyoid, sternothyroid), thyroid isthmus (overlies 2nd-4th rings), innominate artery (crosses anterior trachea at level of sternal notch)
- **Posterior**: Esophagus
- **Lateral**: Carotid sheath (carotid artery, internal jugular vein, vagus nerve), thyroid lobes, recurrent laryngeal nerves (in tracheoesophageal groove)

**Blood Supply**:
- **Upper trachea**: Inferior thyroid artery
- **Lower trachea**: Bronchial arteries
- **Lateral blood supply**: Segmental vessels enter laterally
- **Surgical implication**: Extensive circumferential dissection devascularizes trachea (risk of stenosis)

**Innervation**:
- Recurrent laryngeal nerves (bilateral)

### Pediatric Differences

**Airway**:
- **Funnel-shaped**: Narrowest at cricoid (vs. adult narrowest at cords)
- **Shorter trachea**: 4-5cm in infants
- **Higher larynx**: C3-4 in infants (vs. C5-6 in adults)
- **Larger tongue relative to oral cavity**: Easier obstruction
- **Obligate nasal breathers** (infants <6 months)

## Tracheostomy

### Indications

**Prolonged Mechanical Ventilation**:
- Anticipated ventilator dependence >7-14 days
- **Benefits over translaryngeal intubation**: More comfortable, easier oral care, reduced sedation needs, improved pulmonary toilet, facilitates weaning
- **Timing**: Controversial, but early tracheostomy (within 7-10 days) may reduce ICU length of stay, pneumonia

**Airway Obstruction**:
- **Upper airway**:
  - Laryngeal edema (anaphylaxis, angioedema, infection)
  - Laryngeal/hypopharyngeal tumors
  - Bilateral vocal cord paralysis
  - Trauma (maxillofacial, laryngeal)
- **Subglottic/tracheal stenosis**
- **Obstructive sleep apnea**: Severe, refractory to other treatments (rare indication now)

**Pulmonary Toilet**:
- Inability to clear secretions (neuromuscular disease, high spinal cord injury)
- Decreased consciousness (stroke, traumatic brain injury)

**Airway Protection**:
- Chronic aspiration with impaired laryngeal protective reflexes

### Contraindications

**Relative**:
- Uncorrected coagulopathy (correct before elective procedure)
- Active neck infection
- Poor neck anatomy (obesity, short neck, prior surgery/radiation)

**Absolute**: None if emergent airway needed

### Preoperative Assessment

**History**:
- Indication for tracheostomy
- Duration of intubation
- Prior neck surgery/radiation (scar, distorted anatomy)
- Coagulopathy, anticoagulation

**Physical Examination**:
- **Neck anatomy**: Identify landmarks (thyroid cartilage, cricoid cartilage, sternal notch)
- **Thyroid**: Goiter can overlie trachea
- **Vascular anatomy**: Aberrant vessels rare but possible

**Imaging**:
- **Not routine**, but CT neck if:
  - Aberrant anatomy suspected
  - Tracheal pathology (stenosis, tumor)
  - Prior difficult tracheostomy

**Laboratory**:
- Correct coagulopathy (INR <1.5, platelets >50,000)
- Not needed if emergent

**Consent**: Bleeding, infection, pneumothorax, tube displacement, tracheal stenosis, death (rare)

### Open Surgical Tracheostomy

**Most common technique**, performed in OR or at bedside (ICU)

**Patient Positioning**:
- Supine, neck extended (shoulder roll)
- Arms at sides

**Incision**:
- **Horizontal**: Preferred, 2cm incision midway between cricoid and sternal notch (cosmetically better, follows skin creases)
- **Vertical**: Midline, cricoid to sternal notch (faster, better for difficult anatomy)

**Technique**:

1. **Incision**: Through skin, subcutaneous tissue, platysma
2. **Divide midline raphe**: Separate strap muscles (sternohyoid, sternothyroid) in midline avascular plane
3. **Identify thyroid isthmus**: Usually overlies 2nd-4th tracheal rings
   - **Retract superiorly** (if possible) OR
   - **Divide and ligate**: If thick or limiting access
4. **Expose trachea**: Identify cricoid, tracheal rings (2nd-4th rings ideal for tracheostomy)
5. **Tracheal opening**:
   - **Vertical slit**: 1-1.5cm between rings (most common)
   - **Björk flap**: Inferiorly based flap sutured to skin (facilitates reinsertion if tube dislodges early)
   - **Window**: Excise portion of ring (avoid - increases stenosis risk)
6. **Place tracheostomy tube**:
   - Deflate endotracheal tube cuff, withdraw above tracheostomy site (visualize from above)
   - Insert tracheostomy tube into trachea, inflate cuff, confirm placement (capnography, chest rise)
   - Remove endotracheal tube
7. **Secure tube**: Suture to skin (0 silk) or tracheostomy ties/velcro strap around neck

**Tube Selection**:
- **Size**: Adults typically 6-8 (ID in mm)
  - Larger patients: 8-9
  - Smaller patients, females: 6-7
- **Cuffed vs. uncuffed**: Cuffed for mechanical ventilation (seals airway)
- **Fenestrated**: Holes in posterior wall (allows airflow through larynx when inner cannula removed - for speaking, weaning)

### Percutaneous Dilatational Tracheostomy (PDT)

**Technique**: Bedside (ICU), under bronchoscopic guidance
1. Local anesthetic, small skin incision
2. Needle puncture into trachea (between rings)
3. Guidewire through needle
4. Serial dilators over guidewire to enlarge tract
5. Insert tracheostomy tube over dilator/guidewire
6. Confirm placement with bronchoscopy

**Advantages**: Bedside, no OR, faster, less bleeding, smaller incision
**Disadvantages**: Cannot visualize anatomy directly, higher posterior wall injury risk, not for difficult anatomy
**Contraindications**: Coagulopathy, difficult anatomy, tracheal pathology, need for large tube, pediatric patients

**Comparative Outcomes**: Similar complications to open technique in experienced hands

### Emergency Cricothyroidotomy

**Indication**: "Cannot intubate, cannot oxygenate" emergency (failed intubation, upper airway obstruction)

**Anatomy**: Cricothyroid membrane - between thyroid and cricoid cartilages, avascular midline

**Technique**:
1. Extend neck, palpate thyroid cartilage, cricoid cartilage
2. **Horizontal incision** through skin, cricothyroid membrane
3. Insert tube (tracheostomy tube, endotracheal tube, or specialized cricothyroidotomy tube)
4. Inflate cuff, ventilate, confirm placement

**Convert to tracheostomy**: Within 24-72 hours (cricothyroidotomy higher stenosis risk, subglottic stenosis)

**Pediatric consideration**: Cricothyroidotomy contraindicated <12 years (small cricothyroid membrane, risk of subglottic stenosis) - needle cricothyroidotomy for temporizing, then tracheostomy

### Postoperative Care

**Immediate**:
- **Confirm tube placement**: Capnography (gold standard), chest X-ray
- **Secure tube**: Sutures and ties/strap (prevent dislodgement)
- **First tube change**: NOT before 5-7 days (tract not mature, risk of false passage)
  - If dislodgement before tract mature: DO NOT blindly reinsert - may create false passage, mediastinal dissection
  - **Management**: Oral intubation, then replace tracheostomy tube in OR if needed

**Stoma Care**:
- Clean site twice daily (hydrogen peroxide, saline)
- Gauze dressing under flange (trach pad)
- Keep site dry

**Cuff Management**:
- Inflate cuff if mechanical ventilation needed (20-25 cm H2O pressure - seal but not excessive)
- Deflate cuff for speaking (if not ventilator dependent), assess swallow

**Suctioning**:
- Sterile technique, as needed (not routinely scheduled)
- Depth: No deeper than tube length (avoid tracheal trauma)

**Humidification**:
- CRITICAL (bypasses nasal humidification)
- Heated humidifier or heat and moisture exchanger (HME)
- Prevents mucus plugging, bleeding

**Inner Cannula**:
- Remove and clean daily (if present - prevents obstruction from secretions)

**Routine Tube Changes**:
- **First change**: 5-7 days (allow tract maturation)
- **Subsequent**: Weekly to monthly depending on secretions

### Complications

**Intraoperative**:
- **Bleeding**: Usually minor (skin, thyroid), controlled with cautery/ligation
  - Severe: Thyroid vessels, innominate artery (rare, catastrophic)
- **Pneumothorax**: Apical pleura extends into neck (especially children, COPD, emphysema)
  - Higher risk: Low tracheostomy (below 4th ring), excessive dissection
  - Management: Chest tube if symptomatic
- **Esophageal injury**: Posterior wall perforation (very rare)
- **Recurrent laryngeal nerve injury**: Avoid lateral dissection

**Early Postoperative** (first week):
- **Tube displacement/dislodgement**: MOST DANGEROUS early complication (tract not mature)
  - **Management**: Secure airway (oral intubation), do NOT blindly reinsert
- **Tube obstruction**: Mucus plug, blood clot
  - **Prevention**: Humidification, suctioning, inner cannula cleaning
  - **Management**: Suction, remove inner cannula, change tube if needed
- **Subcutaneous emphysema**: Air tracking into soft tissues (small tracheal opening, poor tube fit)
  - Usually self-limited, monitor for tension pneumothorax
- **Hemorrhage**: Secondary bleeding (POD 3-7) from thyroid vessels, innominate artery
  - **Tracheo-innominate fistula**: RARE (0.5-1%) but often FATAL
    - Suspect if: Pulsatile tube, sentinel bleed (small bleed preceding massive hemorrhage)
    - **Management**: Hyperinflate cuff (tamponade), finger in stoma to compress artery anteriorly, emergent OR

**Late**:
- **Tracheal stenosis** (5-10%):
  - **Causes**: Excessive cuff pressure, prolonged intubation, circumferential tracheal injury, infection
  - **Sites**: Stomal level, cuff level
  - **Prevention**: Maintain cuff pressure <25 cm H2O
  - **Management**: Tracheal resection with anastomosis (if focal), dilation, stenting
- **Granulation tissue**: At stoma or within trachea (bleeding with suctioning, obstruction)
  - **Management**: Silver nitrate application, laser ablation, surgical excision
- **Tracheoesophageal fistula**: Posterior tracheal wall erosion into esophagus (rare)
  - **Risk factors**: Overinflated cuff, nasogastric tube pressing posteriorly
  - **Presentation**: Coughing with eating, recurrent pneumonia, gastric contents in trachea
  - **Management**: Surgical repair
- **Tracheocutaneous fistula**: Persistent tract after decannulation (removal of tube)
  - **Management**: Most close spontaneously; surgical closure if persists >6 months
- **Difficulty decannulation**: Tracheomalacia, stenosis, persistent need for pulmonary toilet

### Decannulation

**Criteria**:
- Underlying indication resolved (no longer ventilator dependent)
- Adequate pulmonary function (can clear secretions)
- Protected airway (no aspiration)
- Awake, following commands

**Process**:
1. **Cuff deflation trial**: Tolerate deflated cuff (ensures upper airway patency)
2. **Downsizing**: Smaller tracheostomy tube
3. **Tracheostomy button or cap**: Occlude tube (breathe through upper airway)
4. **Decannulation**: Remove tube
5. **Stoma closure**: Usually closes spontaneously within days to weeks; occlusive dressing

**Post-decannulation**: Monitor for respiratory distress (stridor, increased work of breathing) - may indicate stenosis, granulation tissue

## Laryngotracheal Stenosis

### Etiology

**Iatrogenic** (most common):
- Prolonged intubation (cuff pressure necrosis)
- Tracheostomy (stomal stenosis)
- Prior airway surgery

**Trauma**:
- Blunt/penetrating neck trauma
- Inhalational injury, burns

**Inflammatory**:
- Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener's)
- Sarcoidosis
- Amyloidosis

**Infectious**:
- Bacterial tracheitis (rare now)
- Fungal (immunocompromised)

**Idiopathic**: Progressive subglottic stenosis (more common in women)

### Classification

**Location**:
- **Glottic**: Vocal cord level
- **Subglottic**: Below vocal cords to cricoid (1cm below cords)
- **Tracheal**: Below cricoid

**Severity** (Cotton-Myer grading):
- **Grade I**: <50% obstruction
- **Grade II**: 50-70% obstruction
- **Grade III**: 70-99% obstruction
- **Grade IV**: Complete obstruction

**Length**: Focal (<1cm) vs. extensive

### Clinical Presentation

**Symptoms**:
- **Dyspnea on exertion**: Early, progresses to rest dyspnea
- **Stridor**: Biphasic (severe stenosis), inspiratory (more common)
- **Cough**, **difficulty clearing secretions**
- **Voice changes**: If glottic/subglottic involvement

**Physical Examination**:
- **Stridor**: Audible without stethoscope (severe)
- **Retractions**: Suprasternal, intercostal (increased work of breathing)
- **Cyanosis**: Late finding (severe obstruction)

### Diagnosis

**Flexible Laryngoscopy**: Office-based, assess supraglottis, glottis, vocal cord mobility

**CT Neck**: Axial and sagittal reconstructions
- Location, length, severity of stenosis
- Surgical planning

**Direct Laryngoscopy and Bronchoscopy**: Under general anesthesia
- **Gold standard** for assessment
- Biopsy if inflammatory/infectious cause suspected
- Measure stenosis (rigid endoscopes of known diameter)

**Pulmonary Function Tests**: Flow-volume loop shows fixed upper airway obstruction (flattened inspiratory and expiratory curves)

### Treatment

**Medical Management**:
- Limited role (steroids for inflammatory causes)

**Endoscopic Treatment**:
- **Dilation**: Balloon or rigid dilators
  - **Indications**: Mild-moderate stenosis, immature scar, temporizing
  - **Limitations**: Recurrence common, repeated dilations risk worsening stenosis
- **Laser excision**: CO2 laser to excise scar, granulation tissue
- **Steroid injection**: Intralesional triamcinolone (reduce inflammation, scarring)
- **Mitomycin-C**: Topical application (inhibit fibroblast proliferation, reduce stenosis recurrence)

**Open Surgical Treatment**:

**Laryngotracheal Reconstruction (LTR)**:
- **Indications**: Moderate-severe subglottic/tracheal stenosis, pediatric patients
- **Technique**:
  - Anterior cricoid split
  - **Cartilage graft** (rib, thyroid) placed to expand airway
  - Anterior graft (anterior stenosis) or anterior + posterior (circumferential stenosis)
- **Single-stage**: Extubate immediately post-op (requires adequate airway diameter)
- **Double-stage**: Maintain tracheostomy, second surgery to remove stent, decannulate

**Cricotracheal Resection (CTR)**:
- **Indications**: Severe subglottic stenosis (adults)
- **Technique**: Resect stenotic segment (cricoid + upper trachea), anastomose trachea to thyroid cartilage
- **Outcomes**: High success rate (>90%), single-stage

**Tracheal Resection and Anastomosis**:
- **Indications**: Focal tracheal stenosis (<4cm length)
- **Technique**: Resect stenotic segment, primary end-to-end anastomosis
- **Mobilization**: Suprahyoid release, inferior pulmonary ligament division (gain length)
- **Outcomes**: 90-95% success rate, gold standard for focal stenosis
- **Complications**: Anastomotic dehiscence, recurrent stenosis

**Tracheostomy**: Bypass stenosis (temporizing or permanent if not surgical candidate)

### Postoperative Care

**Airway Management**:
- Tracheostomy (double-stage) or endotracheal tube/supraglottic stent (single-stage)
- Humidification, pulmonary toilet

**Head Position**:
- Neck flexion (tracheal resection) - reduce tension on anastomosis
- **Guardian suture**: Heavy suture from chin to chest (maintain flexion for 7 days)

**Medications**:
- **Antibiotics**: Perioperative
- **Proton pump inhibitor**: Reduce acid reflux (can worsen stenosis)
- **Steroids**: Controversial

**Diet**: Soft diet initially (reduce swallowing effort, anastomotic stress)

**Follow-Up Endoscopy**: Assess healing, remove granulation tissue

## Special Considerations

### Pediatric Tracheostomy

**Indications**:
- Prolonged ventilation (premature infants, chronic lung disease)
- Upper airway obstruction (craniofacial syndromes, subglottic stenosis)
- Neurologic impairment (impaired secretion clearance)

**Differences from Adult**:
- **Anatomy**: Smaller, higher larynx, shorter trachea
- **Tube**: Uncuffed preferred (smaller diameter, lower pressure injury risk)
- **Complications**: Higher rate of accidental decannulation, obstruction
- **Outcomes**: Many decannulate as grow (airway enlarges, underlying condition improves)

### Bilateral Vocal Cord Paralysis

**Causes**: Thyroidectomy (bilateral RLN injury), intubation trauma, neurologic disease

**Presentation**: Both cords paramedian → airway obstruction (stridor, dyspnea)

**Management**:
- **Acute**: Tracheostomy (bypass obstruction)
- **Chronic**: Cordotomy (widen airway by lateralizing or removing portion of vocal cord)
  - Tradeoff: Improves breathing but worsens voice

### Tracheomalacia

**Definition**: Weakness of tracheal wall, dynamic collapse during respiration

**Causes**: Prolonged intubation/tracheostomy, congenital

**Presentation**: Expiratory wheeze (different from asthma), difficulty weaning from ventilator/tracheostomy

**Diagnosis**: Dynamic bronchoscopy (collapse >50% with expiration)

**Treatment**:
- Mild: Conservative (humidification, pulmonary toilet)
- Severe: CPAP/BiPAP (stent airway open), tracheostomy, surgical tracheal reconstruction/resection (rare)

## Outcomes

**Tracheostomy**:
- **Mortality**: <1% elective, higher for emergent or critically ill patients
- **Morbidity**: Early complications 5-10%, late complications (stenosis) 5-10%
- **Decannulation**: Variable (depends on underlying indication)
  - Prolonged ventilation: Most decannulate
  - Neurologic impairment: Often long-term or permanent

**Laryngotracheal Stenosis Surgery**:
- **Tracheal resection**: 90-95% success (single procedure)
- **Cricotracheal resection**: >90% decannulation rate
- **Laryngotracheal reconstruction**: 70-90% success
- **Endoscopic dilation**: High recurrence, may need multiple procedures

## Key Points

- Tracheostomy indicated for prolonged ventilation (>7-14 days), upper airway obstruction, pulmonary toilet, airway protection
- Open surgical tracheostomy performed at 2nd-4th tracheal rings; avoid first ring (subglottic stenosis risk) and low placement (innominate artery injury)
- Percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy (PDT) alternative to open, performed at bedside under bronchoscopic guidance; contraindicated in difficult anatomy
- Emergency cricothyroidotomy for "cannot intubate, cannot oxygenate" scenario; convert to tracheostomy within 24-72 hours
- Tube dislodgement before tract maturation (first 5-7 days) is most dangerous early complication; DO NOT blindly reinsert, secure airway orally first
- Tracheo-innominate fistula rare (0.5-1%) but often fatal; suspect with pulsatile tube or sentinel bleed; emergent management with cuff hyperinflation and operative control
- Tracheal stenosis (5-10%) most common late complication; prevent with cuff pressure <25 cm H2O
- Laryngotracheal stenosis most often iatrogenic (prolonged intubation, tracheostomy); also trauma, inflammatory, idiopathic
- Tracheal resection and anastomosis gold standard for focal tracheal stenosis (<4cm), 90-95% success rate
- Cricotracheal resection for severe subglottic stenosis in adults; laryngotracheal reconstruction with cartilage graft for pediatric stenosis
- Humidification critical post-tracheostomy (prevents mucus plugging); bypass natural nasal humidification
- Decannulation criteria: Underlying indication resolved, adequate pulmonary function, protected airway, upper airway patency confirmed
