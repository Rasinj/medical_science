# Thyroid and Parathyroid Surgery

## Overview

Thyroid and parathyroid surgery addresses benign and malignant disorders of these endocrine glands located in the anterior neck. Common indications include thyroid cancer, toxic goiter, large benign nodules, and hyperparathyroidism. Modern approaches emphasize nerve preservation, minimally invasive techniques when appropriate, and comprehensive preoperative assessment. Successful outcomes require detailed anatomic knowledge, meticulous surgical technique, and understanding of endocrine physiology.

## Thyroid Anatomy

**Gross Anatomy**:
- Two lateral lobes connected by isthmus
- Located anterior to trachea at levels C5-T1
- Normal weight: 15-25 grams
- Blood supply: Superior and inferior thyroid arteries
- Venous drainage: Superior, middle, inferior thyroid veins

**Critical Anatomic Relationships**:
- **Recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN)**: Motor to vocal cords
  - Right RLN: Loops around subclavian artery, more lateral course
  - Left RLN: Loops around aortic arch, more vertical course in tracheoesophageal groove
  - At risk during thyroid surgery (injury causes vocal cord paralysis)
- **External branch of superior laryngeal nerve (EBSLN)**: Motor to cricothyroid muscle
  - Runs with superior thyroid vessels
  - Injury causes voice fatigue, loss of high pitch
- **Parathyroid glands**: Usually 4 glands (superior and inferior pairs)
  - Variable location, blood supply from inferior thyroid artery
  - At risk during thyroidectomy (inadvertent removal/devascularization)

## Thyroid Disease

### Thyroid Nodules

**Epidemiology**:
- Palpable nodules: 4-7% of population
- Ultrasound-detected nodules: 50-60% (very common)
- Malignancy risk: 5-15% of nodules
- More common in women (4:1 ratio)

**Evaluation**:
- **TSH**: Screen for hyper/hypothyroidism
- **Ultrasound**: Characterize nodule
  - **High-risk features**: Hypoechoic, microcalcifications, taller than wide, irregular margins, increased vascularity
  - **Low-risk**: Spongiform, purely cystic
- **Fine needle aspiration (FNA)** biopsy:
  - Indications: Nodules >1cm with suspicious features, any size if clinically concerning
  - **Bethesda classification**:
    - I: Non-diagnostic (repeat FNA)
    - II: Benign (15-30% malignancy risk if molecular testing suspicious)
    - III: Atypia of undetermined significance (10-30% malignancy)
    - IV: Follicular neoplasm (25-40% malignancy)
    - V: Suspicious for malignancy (50-75%)
    - VI: Malignant (97-99%)
  - Molecular testing (Afirma, ThyroSeq) for indeterminate nodules

**Indications for Surgery**:
- Malignant or suspicious cytology (Bethesda V-VI)
- Indeterminate cytology with suspicious molecular testing
- Large nodules causing symptoms (dysphagia, dyspnea, cosmesis)
- Substernal extension
- Hyperthyroidism (see below)

### Thyroid Cancer

**Types**:
- **Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC)** (85%): Best prognosis, lymphatic spread
- **Follicular thyroid carcinoma (FTC)** (10%): Hematogenous spread
- **Medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC)** (3-4%): C-cell origin, calcitonin secretion, 25% hereditary (RET mutation, MEN 2)
- **Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC)** (<2%): Aggressive, poor prognosis
- **Thyroid lymphoma** (rare): Often in setting of Hashimoto thyroiditis

**Risk Stratification**:
- **Low risk**: PTC <4cm, no extrathyroidal extension, no lymph nodes, no distant mets
- **Intermediate risk**: PTC >4cm or microscopic extrathyroidal extension or few lymph nodes
- **High risk**: Gross extrathyroidal extension, incomplete resection, distant metastases

**Staging** (AJCC 8th edition):
- Age now cutoff at 55 years (previously 45)
- Under 55: Stage I (any T/N, M0) or Stage II (M1)
- Over 55: Standard T/N/M staging

### Hyperthyroidism

**Causes**:
- **Graves' disease** (70%): Autoimmune (TSI antibodies)
- **Toxic multinodular goiter** (20%)
- **Toxic adenoma** (5%)

**Treatment Options**:
- Antithyroid drugs (methimazole, PTU)
- Radioactive iodine (RAI)
- Surgery (thyroidectomy)

**Indications for Surgery**:
- Failed medical management or RAI
- Large goiter with compressive symptoms
- Pregnancy (second trimester safest)
- Thyroid cancer concern
- Patient preference

## Thyroidectomy

### Preoperative Preparation

**Laboratory**:
- TSH, free T4 (assess thyroid function)
- Calcium (baseline for postoperative comparison)
- CBC if concern for malignancy

**Imaging**:
- Neck ultrasound (evaluate nodule, lymph nodes)
- CT neck/chest if substernal extension (non-contrast if RAI planned)

**Laryngoscopy**:
- Assess vocal cord function preoperatively
- Especially if: Prior neck surgery, voice changes, bilateral surgery planned, reoperation

**Euthyroid State**:
- Graves' disease: Must achieve euthyroid state before surgery (risk thyroid storm)
- Methimazole +/- beta-blocker until TSH normalized

**Informed Consent**:
- Risks: RLN injury (1-2% temporary, <1% permanent), hypoparathyroidism, bleeding, infection, scar
- Need for lifelong thyroid hormone replacement (if total thyroidectomy)

### Extent of Surgery

**Thyroid Lobectomy (Hemithyroidectomy)**:
- Remove one lobe + isthmus
- **Indications**:
  - Bethesda III-IV nodules (indeterminate)
  - Low-risk PTC <4cm, no extrathyroidal extension, no lymph nodes
  - Toxic adenoma
  - Symptomatic benign nodule (one side)
- **Advantages**: Preserve thyroid function (70-80%), lower hypoparathyroidism risk, lower RLN injury risk
- **Disadvantages**: May need completion thyroidectomy if malignancy found on final pathology

**Total Thyroidectomy**:
- Remove both lobes + isthmus
- **Indications**:
  - Malignant cytology (Bethesda VI)
  - Bilateral nodules
  - Graves' disease
  - Large goiter
  - Desire for RAI ablation (requires total thyroidectomy)
  - Family history of thyroid cancer
- **Advantages**: Definitive treatment, allows RAI, no reoperation risk
- **Disadvantages**: Lifelong thyroid replacement, higher hypoparathyroidism risk

**Completion Thyroidectomy**:
- Remove remaining lobe after prior lobectomy
- **Indications**: Malignancy found on final pathology requiring total thyroidectomy (e.g., PTC >4cm, aggressive histology, multifocal disease)
- Higher RLN injury risk (scar tissue)

### Surgical Technique

**Patient Positioning**:
- Supine with neck extended (shoulder roll)
- Arms tucked
- Neck slightly extended (not hyperextended - increases intracranial pressure)

**Incision**:
- Low collar incision (1-2cm above sternal notch)
- 4-6cm length (adjust based on gland size)
- Marking with patient upright (lies in natural skin crease)

**Surgical Steps**:

1. **Incision**: Through skin, platysma
2. **Subplatysmal flaps**: Superior to thyroid cartilage, inferior to sternal notch
3. **Midline raphe division**: Separate strap muscles (sternohyoid, sternothyroid)
4. **Mobilize lobe**: Retract strap muscles laterally
5. **Superior pole dissection**:
   - Ligate superior thyroid vessels individually (avoid mass ligation - EBSLN injury)
   - Identify and preserve EBSLN if possible
6. **Middle thyroid vein**: Ligate (variable presence)
7. **Inferior pole mobilization**: Mobilize inferior pole medially
8. **RLN identification** (CRITICAL):
   - **Identify RLN before ligating inferior thyroid artery**
   - Typically in tracheoesophageal groove
   - Trace to laryngeal entry point (confirm anatomy)
   - **Methods**: Visual identification (gold standard), nerve monitoring (adjunct)
9. **Inferior thyroid artery ligation**: Ligate branches (preserve blood supply to parathyroids)
10. **Parathyroid identification and preservation**:
    - Identify parathyroid glands (tan, 4-6mm, distinct from fat/lymph nodes)
    - Preserve in situ with blood supply
    - If devascularized: Autotransplant (mince and implant in sternocleidomastoid or forearm)
11. **Divide Berry's ligament**: Posterior suspensory ligament (RLN very close here)
12. **Remove thyroid lobe**: Dissect off trachea
13. **Repeat for contralateral side** (if total thyroidectomy)
14. **Hemostasis**: Meticulous - prevent hematoma
15. **Drain**: Controversial (may place if extensive dissection, large goiter)
16. **Closure**: Reapproximate strap muscles, platysma, skin (subcuticular for best cosmesis)

**Nerve Monitoring**:
- Intraoperative neuromonitoring (IONM)
- Stimulate RLN and EBSLN, monitor vocal cord movement (EMG)
- **Benefits**: Confirm nerve identification, predict postoperative function
- **Limitations**: Not foolproof (can have false negatives), does not replace visual identification

**Minimally Invasive Approaches**:
- **Minimally invasive video-assisted thyroidectomy (MIVAT)**: Small central incision, endoscopic assistance
- **Robotic/endoscopic thyroidectomy**: Axillary, transoral approaches (cosmetic benefit, longer operative time)
- **Indications**: Small glands, selected patients desiring minimal scar
- Not for cancer, large glands, or extensive surgery

### Lymph Node Dissection

**Central Compartment (Level VI)**:
- Pretracheal, paratracheal, prelaryngeal (Delphian) nodes
- **Indications**:
  - Clinically involved central nodes (therapeutic dissection)
  - T3/T4 tumors, advanced PTC (prophylactic dissection - controversial)
  - MTC (routine)
- **Technique**: Remove nodes between carotid arteries, hyoid to innominate vessels
- Risks: Higher hypoparathyroidism, RLN injury

**Lateral Neck Dissection (Levels I-V)**:
- **Indications**: Clinically or radiographically involved lateral nodes (FNA-proven)
- **Modified radical neck dissection**: Remove lymph nodes, preserve sternocleidomastoid, internal jugular vein, spinal accessory nerve
- **Radical neck dissection**: Remove above structures (rare for thyroid cancer)

### Postoperative Care

**Immediate**:
- Monitor for airway compromise (hematoma, bilateral RLN injury)
- HOB elevated
- Drain output monitoring (remove when <30mL/day, typically POD 1-2)

**Calcium Monitoring**:
- Check calcium and PTH on POD 1 (or 4-6 hours postoperatively)
- **Symptomatic hypocalcemia**: Perioral tingling, paresthesias, muscle cramps, tetany, seizures (severe)
- **Chvostek sign**: Tap facial nerve, facial muscle contraction
- **Trousseau sign**: BP cuff inflated, carpopedal spasm
- **Treatment**: Calcium supplementation (oral or IV if severe), calcitriol if PTH low

**Thyroid Hormone**:
- Start levothyroxine if total thyroidectomy (1.6 mcg/kg/day)
- Higher dose initially if RAI ablation planned (goal TSH <0.1)
- Check TSH at 6 weeks, adjust dose

**Voice Assessment**:
- Assess voice quality before discharge
- Laryngoscopy if voice changes, stridor, or bilateral surgery

**Drain**: Remove when output <30mL/day

**Discharge**: POD 1-2 typically

**Follow-Up**:
- 1-2 weeks: Wound check, calcium/PTH, voice assessment
- 6 weeks: TSH, free T4, adjust thyroid replacement
- Long-term: Thyroglobulin (tumor marker for thyroid cancer follow-up), ultrasound surveillance

### Complications

**Early**:
- **Hematoma** (1-2%):
  - Acute airway compromise (compressive hematoma)
  - Signs: Neck swelling, respiratory distress, stridor
  - **Management**: Open wound at bedside immediately (remove skin sutures, evacuate clot), return to OR for definitive control
- **RLN injury** (1-2% temporary, <1% permanent per nerve at risk):
  - **Unilateral injury**: Hoarseness, weak voice, aspiration
  - **Bilateral injury**: Stridor, respiratory distress, may need tracheostomy
  - Most temporary injuries recover in 3-6 months
- **Hypocalcemia** (transient 20-30%, permanent 1-3%):
  - Due to hypoparathyroidism (removal/devascularization of parathyroids)
  - More common after total thyroidectomy, central neck dissection
  - Transient: Resolves within 6 months
  - Permanent: Requires lifelong calcium and vitamin D supplementation
- **Bleeding/seroma**
- **Infection** (<1%)

**Late**:
- **Hypothyroidism**: Expected after total thyroidectomy, 20-30% after lobectomy
- **Scar/keloid**: Minimize with meticulous closure, scar massage
- **Tracheomalacia**: Rare (long-standing large goiter compressing trachea)

### Thyroid Cancer Management

**Postoperative RAI Ablation**:
- **Indications**: High-risk disease, some intermediate-risk
- Administered 4-6 weeks post-thyroidectomy
- Requires TSH stimulation (withdrawal of thyroid hormone or rhTSH injection)
- Ablates remnant thyroid tissue and micrometastases

**TSH Suppression**:
- Goal TSH <0.1 for high-risk, 0.1-0.5 for intermediate-risk, 0.5-2 for low-risk
- Levothyroxine dose adjusted to achieve target

**Surveillance**:
- Thyroglobulin (tumor marker) every 6-12 months
- Neck ultrasound every 6-12 months
- Detect recurrence early

**Prognosis**:
- PTC: Excellent (>95% 10-year survival for low-risk)
- FTC: Very good (90-95% 10-year survival)
- MTC: Good if localized (80-90% 10-year survival), worse if distant mets
- ATC: Poor (median survival 6 months)

## Parathyroid Glands

### Anatomy
- Usually 4 glands (superior and inferior pairs)
- **Superior parathyroids**: More consistent location (posterior thyroid, above RLN entry)
- **Inferior parathyroids**: Variable location (below RLN, can descend to mediastinum)
- **Size**: 4-6mm, tan color
- Blood supply: Inferior thyroid artery branches
- **Ectopic locations**: Thymus, mediastinum, retroesophageal, intrathyroidal (1-3%)

### Hyperparathyroidism

**Primary Hyperparathyroidism**:
- **Causes**: Adenoma (85%), hyperplasia (10-15%), carcinoma (<1%)
- **Presentation**: Hypercalcemia (often asymptomatic)
  - Symptoms: "Stones, bones, abdominal groans, psychiatric overtones"
  - Nephrolithiasis, osteoporosis, peptic ulcer, pancreatitis, fatigue, depression
- **Diagnosis**: Elevated calcium, elevated or inappropriately normal PTH
- **Imaging**:
  - **Sestamibi scan**: Localizes adenoma (sensitivity 70-90%)
  - **Ultrasound**: Identify adenoma (operator dependent)
  - **4D-CT**: High sensitivity, useful if other studies negative

**Secondary Hyperparathyroidism**:
- Compensatory response to chronic hypocalcemia (chronic kidney disease)
- All 4 glands hyperplastic
- **Treatment**: Medical management, rarely surgery (subtotal parathyroidectomy)

**Tertiary Hyperparathyroidism**:
- Autonomous PTH secretion after prolonged secondary hyperparathyroidism
- Occurs after kidney transplant

### Indications for Parathyroidectomy

**Absolute**:
- Symptomatic hyperparathyroidism (nephrolithiasis, osteoporosis, fractures)
- Calcium >1 mg/dL above normal
- Age <50 years
- Creatinine clearance <60 mL/min

**Relative**:
- Asymptomatic with osteoporosis or fractures
- Nephrolithiasis or nephrocalcinosis
- Patient preference

### Surgical Approaches

**Focused (Minimally Invasive) Parathyroidectomy**:
- **Indications**: Single adenoma localized on imaging
- **Technique**:
  - Small (2-3cm) incision over adenoma
  - Identify and remove adenoma
  - Confirm with intraoperative PTH (IOPTH)
    - >50% drop from baseline at 10 minutes post-excision predicts cure
  - No routine exploration of other glands
- **Advantages**: Smaller incision, faster recovery, outpatient
- **Success**: >95% cure if imaging concordant

**Bilateral Neck Exploration**:
- **Indications**: Negative or discordant imaging, suspected hyperplasia, reoperative surgery, parathyroid cancer
- **Technique**:
  - Standard thyroid incision
  - Identify all 4 parathyroid glands
  - Remove adenoma(s) or subtotal parathyroidectomy (if hyperplasia)
- **Advantages**: Direct visualization of all glands, higher success if ectopic or multiple gland disease

**Subtotal Parathyroidectomy** (for hyperplasia):
- Remove 3.5 glands (leave 50mg remnant - size of normal gland)
- Mark remnant with clip
- Or total parathyroidectomy with autotransplant (forearm)

**Intraoperative PTH**:
- Draw PTH before excision (baseline)
- Draw PTH 5 and 10 minutes after excision
- >50% drop indicates likely cure (removed all hyperfunctioning tissue)
- Allows focused approach, confirms adequate resection

**Reoperative Parathyroidectomy**:
- Challenging (scar tissue, RLN risk higher)
- Thorough imaging preoperatively
- Consider focused approach if well-localized
- May need sternotomy if mediastinal adenoma

### Postoperative Care

**Calcium Monitoring**:
- Check calcium postoperatively and daily until stable
- **Hungry bone syndrome**: Severe hypocalcemia after parathyroidectomy (especially if high preoperative PTH, bone disease)
  - Bone rapidly uptakes calcium
  - Requires aggressive calcium and vitamin D supplementation

**Discharge**: Same day or POD 1

**Follow-Up**:
- Calcium and PTH at 2 weeks, 6 months
- Assess for recurrence or persistent disease

### Complications

- RLN injury (1-2%)
- Hypocalcemia (transient 10-20%, permanent 1-2%)
- Persistent hyperparathyroidism (5-10%): Missed adenoma, supernumerary gland
- Recurrent hyperparathyroidism (2-5%): New adenoma, hyperplasia
- Hematoma, infection (rare)

## Key Points

- Thyroidectomy requires meticulous RLN and parathyroid preservation
- Lobectomy appropriate for many low-risk thyroid cancers and indeterminate nodules
- Total thyroidectomy indicated for bilateral disease, Graves', and most thyroid cancers
- RLN injury causes vocal cord paralysis (hoarseness unilateral, airway compromise bilateral)
- Hypocalcemia most common after total thyroidectomy, usually transient
- Nerve monitoring is adjunct, not replacement for visual RLN identification
- Parathyroidectomy cures primary hyperparathyroidism in >95%
- Focused parathyroidectomy effective if single adenoma localized on imaging
- Intraoperative PTH confirms adequate resection during parathyroidectomy
- Hungry bone syndrome can cause severe hypocalcemia after parathyroidectomy
