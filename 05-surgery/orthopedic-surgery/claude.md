# Orthopedic Surgery

## Overview
Orthopedic surgery focuses on the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of disorders of the musculoskeletal system. This includes bones, joints, ligaments, tendons, muscles, and nerves. Orthopedic surgeons manage both traumatic injuries and degenerative conditions using operative and non-operative approaches.
