# Pediatric Orthopedics

## Overview

Pediatric orthopedics focuses on musculoskeletal disorders in infants, children, and adolescents. Unlike adult orthopedics, pediatric conditions often involve growth-related abnormalities, congenital deformities, and unique injury patterns related to the developing skeleton. Understanding growth and development, physeal anatomy, and the remodeling potential of pediatric bones is essential for optimal treatment. Many conditions are self-limiting and require only observation, while others necessitate early intervention to prevent long-term disability.

## Growth and Development

### Skeletal Maturation

**Bone Formation**
- **Intramembranous ossification**: Flat bones (skull, clavicle)
- **Endochondral ossification**: Long bones
  - Primary ossification center: Diaphysis (prenatal)
  - Secondary ossification centers: Epiphyses (postnatal)

**Physeal (Growth Plate) Anatomy**
- **Zones of physis**:
  1. **Reserve zone**: Stem cells, storage
  2. **Proliferative zone**: Rapid cell division, columns of chondrocytes
  3. **Hypertrophic zone**: Cell enlargement, matrix calcification
  4. **Zone of provisional calcification**: Vascular invasion, bone formation
- **Location**: Between metaphysis and epiphysis
- **Function**: Longitudinal bone growth
- **Closure timing**: Variable by location (distal femur 14-16 years, proximal humerus 18-20 years)

**Skeletal Maturity Assessment**
- **Risser sign**: Iliac apophysis ossification (0-5)
  - 0: No ossification
  - 1-4: Progressive ossification lateral to medial
  - 5: Complete fusion
- **Bone age**: Hand and wrist radiograph compared to atlas
- **Triradiate cartilage**: Acetabulum, closes 12-14 years

### Growth Patterns

**Peak Height Velocity**
- Girls: 12 years (range 10-14)
- Boys: 14 years (range 12-16)

**Longitudinal Growth Contribution**
- Proximal femur: 30%
- Distal femur: 70% (9 mm/year, most of lower extremity growth)
- Proximal tibia: 55%
- Distal tibia: 45%
- Proximal humerus: 80%
- Distal radius: 75%

**Remodeling Potential**
- Greater in younger children
- Greater near physis
- Better in plane of motion (e.g., sagittal plane in knee)
- Angular deformities remodel better than rotational
- **Rules**: Acceptable angulation varies by age and location

## Developmental Dysplasia of the Hip (DDH)

### Definition and Epidemiology

**Definition**
- Spectrum of hip abnormalities from mild dysplasia to frank dislocation
- Previously termed "congenital hip dislocation"

**Incidence**
- 1-2 per 1,000 live births (frank dislocation)
- 10-20 per 1,000 (instability or dysplasia)

**Risk Factors**
- Female sex (6:1 ratio)
- First-born child
- Breech presentation
- Family history (20% have affected relative)
- Oligohydramnios
- Torticollis, metatarsus adductus (packaging disorders)
- Native American or European descent

### Pathoanatomy

**Normal Hip Development**
- Acetabulum develops in response to presence of femoral head
- Femoral head maintains reduction and stimulates normal acetabular development

**Dysplasia Spectrum**
- **Dysplasia**: Shallow acetabulum, femoral head remains in socket
- **Subluxation**: Partial displacement
- **Dislocation**: Complete displacement, femoral head out of acetabulum

**Secondary Changes (Untreated)**
- Acetabular dysplasia worsens
- Femoral head flattening
- Anteverted femoral neck
- Limbus hypertrophy (inverted labrum blocks reduction)
- Capsular laxity and redundancy

### Clinical Presentation

**Newborn and Infant (<6 months)**
- **Physical examination**:
  - **Barlow maneuver**: Adduction + posterior force → hip dislocates
  - **Ortolani maneuver**: Abduction + anterior force → hip reduces (clunk)
  - Positive "clunk" indicates reducible dislocation
  - Soft "click" is common, usually not pathologic
- **Limited abduction**: Late sign, indicates irreducible dislocation
- Asymmetric thigh folds (not specific)

**Older Infant (6-12 months)**
- **Galeazzi sign**: Knee height asymmetry (supine, hips and knees flexed)
- Limited abduction
- Asymmetric crawling

**Walking Age (>12 months)**
- **Trendelenburg gait**: Pelvic drop on contralateral side (abductor weakness)
- Toe-walking
- Lumbar lordosis (bilateral dislocation)
- Leg length discrepancy

### Diagnostic Evaluation

**Screening**
- **Universal screening**: Physical examination of all newborns
- **High-risk screening**: Risk factors present

**Imaging**

**Ultrasound (Birth to 4-6 months)**
- Avoids radiation
- **Graf classification**:
  - **Type I**: Normal (alpha angle >60°)
  - **Type II**: Immature or dysplastic (alpha angle 43-60°)
  - **Type III**: Decentered (alpha angle <43°)
  - **Type IV**: Dislocated
- **Dynamic examination**: Assess stability

**Radiographs (>4-6 months)**
- Femoral head ossifies, allows visualization
- **Measurements**:
  - **Hilgenreiner line**: Horizontal line through triradiate cartilage
  - **Perkins line**: Vertical line at lateral acetabular edge
  - **Shenton line**: Arc from femoral neck to superior obturator foramen (should be smooth)
  - **Acetabular index**: Angle of acetabular roof (normal <30° at birth, <25° at 1 year)
  - **Center-edge angle (Wiberg)**: >20° normal (after age 5)

### Treatment

**Age <6 Months: Pavlik Harness**

**Indications**
- Reducible or dislocatable hip
- Age <6 months (best results <3 months)

**Mechanism**
- Maintains hip in flexion (90-110°) and abduction (40-60°)
- Allows active motion, promotes normal development
- "Safe zone" position

**Protocol**
- Full-time wear (23 hours/day) for 6-12 weeks
- Weekly ultrasound until stable, then every 2-4 weeks
- Wean gradually once stable

**Success Rate**
- 85-95% if started <2 months
- 70-85% if started 2-6 months

**Failure Criteria**
- Hip remains dislocated after 3-4 weeks
- Femoral nerve palsy develops
- Avascular necrosis develops

**Contraindications**
- Irreducible hip
- Age >6 months

**Age 6-18 Months: Closed vs. Open Reduction**

**Closed Reduction**
- **Indications**: Age 6-18 months, reducible hip
- **Technique**:
  - Examination under anesthesia
  - Arthrogram to confirm concentric reduction
  - Gentle reduction maneuver
  - Spica cast in "human position" (flexion 90-110°, abduction 40-50°)
- **Cast duration**: 3-6 months, changed under anesthesia every 6-8 weeks
- **Success rate**: 70-85%
- **Risks**: Avascular necrosis (5-10%)

**Open Reduction**
- **Indications**:
  - Failed closed reduction
  - Age >18 months
  - Irreducible hip (limbus, hypertrophied ligamentum teres, pulvinar)
- **Approaches**:
  - **Medial approach**: Age <12 months, lower AVN risk
  - **Anterior approach**: Age >12 months, better visualization
- **Technique**:
  - Remove obstacles to reduction (limbus, pulvinar, ligamentum teres)
  - Ensure concentric reduction
  - Capsulorrhaphy (tighten capsule)
  - Spica cast
- **Adjunct procedures**:
  - **Femoral shortening**: Reduce pressure on femoral head (older children)
  - **Pelvic osteotomy**: Improve acetabular coverage

**Age >18 Months: Open Reduction + Osteotomy**

**Indications**
- Late-presenting DDH
- Residual dysplasia after closed/open reduction

**Procedures**
- **Femoral osteotomy**: Correct excessive anteversion, varus
- **Pelvic osteotomy**:
  - **Salter osteotomy**: Age 18 months to 8 years, redirect acetabulum
  - **Pemberton osteotomy**: Hinge on triradiate cartilage
  - **Dega osteotomy**: Similar to Pemberton
  - **Shelf procedure**: Create buttress above femoral head (salvage)
  - **Periacetabular osteotomy (PAO)**: Skeletally mature, complex redirection

### Complications

**Avascular Necrosis (AVN)**
- Most serious complication (5-60% depending on treatment)
- **Risk factors**: Forceful reduction, abduction >60° in spica, delayed treatment
- **Classification (Kalamchi-MacEwen)**:
  - Type I: Changes in ossific nucleus only
  - Type II: Lateral physeal damage
  - Type III: Central physeal damage
  - Type IV: Total damage
- **Prevention**: Gentle reduction, "safe zone" positioning, avoid excessive abduction

**Residual Dysplasia**
- May require osteotomy

**Redislocation**
- 5-10% after closed reduction

**Osteoarthritis**
- Long-term risk if untreated or AVN develops

### Outcomes

- Early diagnosis and treatment (<6 months): Excellent outcomes, normal hip development
- Late diagnosis (>18 months): Increased risk of AVN, residual dysplasia, osteoarthritis
- Untreated DDH: Limb-length discrepancy, early osteoarthritis, pain, limp

## Clubfoot (Congenital Talipes Equinovarus)

### Definition and Epidemiology

**Definition**
- Complex deformity characterized by:
  - **Equinus**: Plantarflexion of ankle
  - **Varus**: Inversion of hindfoot
  - **Adductus**: Forefoot adduction
  - **Cavus**: Elevated medial longitudinal arch

**Incidence**
- 1-2 per 1,000 live births
- Male predominance (2:1)
- Bilateral in 50%

**Risk Factors**
- Family history (10-fold increased risk)
- Oligohydramnios
- Neuromuscular disorders (spina bifida, arthrogryposis)
- Genetic syndromes

### Pathoanatomy

**Structural Abnormalities**
- Talus: Shortened, plantarflexed
- Calcaneus: Inverted, plantarflexed beneath talus
- Navicular: Displaced medially, articulates with medial malleolus
- Subtalar joint: Fixed in varus and equinus
- Soft tissue: Medial and posterior contractures

**Classification**
- **Idiopathic**: Isolated, no other abnormalities (majority)
- **Syndromic**: Associated with other anomalies or syndromes
- **Teratologic**: Arthrogryposis, myelomeningocele (rigid, poor prognosis)

### Clinical Presentation

**Physical Examination**
- Hindfoot equinus and varus
- Forefoot adductus
- Midfoot cavus
- Deep posterior and medial creases
- Calf atrophy (mild)
- **Flexibility**: Assess rigidity, reducibility

**Associated Findings**
- Hip dysplasia (10%)
- Torticollis
- Metatarsus adductus

### Diagnostic Evaluation

**Clinical Diagnosis**
- Based on physical examination

**Imaging**
- **Radiographs**: Rarely needed initially
  - AP and lateral stress views (if obtained)
  - Talocalcaneal angle: Decreased (<20° on AP, <35° on lateral)
- **Ultrasound**: Not routinely used

**Differential Diagnosis**
- Metatarsus adductus (forefoot only)
- Positional clubfoot (flexible, corrects to neutral)
- Vertical talus (rocker-bottom foot)

### Treatment

**Ponseti Method** (Gold Standard)

**Principles**
- Sequential manipulation and casting
- Correct deformities in specific order:
  1. Cavus (supinate forefoot)
  2. Adductus and varus (abduct forefoot, evert hindfoot)
  3. Equinus (percutaneous Achilles tenotomy)

**Protocol**
1. **Serial casting** (5-7 casts):
   - Weekly cast changes
   - Long-leg casts, knee flexed 90°
   - Gentle manipulation before each cast
   - Abduction increased progressively to 60-70°

2. **Achilles tenotomy**:
   - Indicated if equinus remains after casting (90% of cases)
   - Percutaneous, local anesthesia
   - Final cast for 3 weeks

3. **Bracing** (Foot Abduction Orthosis):
   - After final cast removal
   - Full-time (23 hours/day) for 3 months
   - Part-time (nights and naps, 12-14 hours/day) until age 4-5 years
   - **Critical for success**: Prevents recurrence

**Success Rate**
- 90-95% avoid extensive surgery
- Correction achieved in 5-7 casts typically

**Compliance**
- **Bracing compliance**: Most important factor in preventing recurrence
- Non-compliance: 80% recurrence rate
- Compliance: 10-15% recurrence rate

**Recurrence**
- **Treatment**: Repeat casting ± tibialis anterior tendon transfer (age >2.5 years)

**Extensive Soft Tissue Release**

**Indications**
- Failed Ponseti method (rare)
- Late-presenting clubfoot (>2 years)
- Neglected clubfoot
- Resistant/teratologic clubfoot

**Technique**
- Posteromedial release
- Lengthen Achilles, posterior tibialis, flexor tendons
- Release posterior and medial ligaments
- Correct all components simultaneously

**Disadvantages**
- Extensive surgical dissection
- Longer recovery
- Risk of overcorrection, stiffness, weakness
- Inferior outcomes compared to Ponseti

### Postoperative Management (Ponseti Method)

**After Achilles Tenotomy**
- Cast: 3 weeks
- Bracing: Begin immediately after cast removal

**After Soft Tissue Release** (if performed)
- Cast: 6-12 weeks
- Physical therapy, bracing

### Complications

**Recurrence** (10-40%)
- Most common complication
- Risk factors: Non-compliance with bracing, age <2 years at presentation
- Treatment: Repeat casting, possible tibialis anterior tendon transfer

**Undercorrection**
- Residual deformity
- May require revision casting or surgery

**Overcorrection**
- Rare with Ponseti method
- Valgus hindfoot, dorsiflexion contracture
- More common after extensive release

**Skin Breakdown**
- During casting, vigilance required

**Rocker-Bottom Foot**
- Iatrogenic, incorrect casting technique (dorsiflexion before hindfoot correction)

### Outcomes

**Ponseti Method**
- 90-95% good to excellent outcomes
- Functional, plantigrade foot
- Able to wear normal shoes
- Mild calf atrophy persists (cosmetic)

**Long-Term**
- Some activity limitations (competitive sports)
- Occasional pain or stiffness in adulthood

## Legg-Calvé-Perthes Disease

### Definition and Epidemiology

**Definition**
- Idiopathic avascular necrosis of the femoral head in children
- Self-limiting, but can lead to femoral head deformity and early osteoarthritis

**Incidence**
- 1-5 per 10,000 children
- Peak age: 4-8 years (range 2-12)
- Male predominance (4:1)
- Bilateral in 10-20% (usually asymmetric)

**Risk Factors**
- Low socioeconomic status
- Family history
- Delayed bone age
- Low birth weight
- Smoke exposure

### Pathophysiology

**Vascular Insult**
- Disruption of blood supply to femoral head (lateral epiphyseal vessels)
- Etiology unknown (repetitive trauma, hypercoagulability, synovitis)

**Stages (Waldenström)**
1. **Initial/Necrosis** (0-6 months):
   - Avascular necrosis, no radiographic changes initially
   - Synovitis, pain, limp

2. **Fragmentation** (6-12 months):
   - Subchondral fracture
   - Femoral head fragmentation on radiograph
   - "Crescent sign": Subchondral lucency

3. **Reossification** (1-3 years):
   - Revascularization, new bone formation
   - Gradual healing

4. **Healed/Remodeling** (3+ years):
   - Final femoral head shape determined
   - Remodeling continues until skeletal maturity

### Clinical Presentation

**Symptoms**
- Insidious onset
- Hip, thigh, or knee pain (referred)
- Painless limp
- Decreased activity tolerance

**Physical Examination**
- **Range of motion**: Decreased abduction and internal rotation (early, specific finding)
- Leg length discrepancy (mild)
- Atrophy (thigh, buttock)
- Trendelenburg gait
- **Stulberg sign**: Limited internal rotation in extension

### Diagnostic Evaluation

**Radiographs**
- **AP and frog-leg lateral pelvis**
- **Initial stage**: May be normal or subtle findings
  - Widened joint space (synovitis)
  - Small femoral epiphysis
- **Fragmentation stage**:
  - **Crescent sign**: Subchondral fracture (pathognomonic)
  - Femoral head fragmentation, sclerosis
  - Metaphyseal cysts
- **Reossification stage**:
  - New bone formation
  - Progressive healing
- **Healed stage**:
  - Final head shape: Round vs. flat, large vs. small

**MRI**
- Early diagnosis (before radiographic changes)
- Extent of necrosis
- Cartilage abnormalities
- Not routinely necessary

**Bone Scan**
- Historic use, extent of necrosis
- Largely replaced by MRI

### Classification

**Lateral Pillar Classification (Herring)** - Most Prognostic

**Measured at fragmentation stage**
- **Group A**: No loss of lateral pillar height (best prognosis)
  - Treatment: Observation
- **Group B**: >50% lateral pillar height maintained
  - Treatment: Variable (observation vs. containment)
- **Group B/C Border**: 50% lateral pillar height
- **Group C**: <50% lateral pillar height (worst prognosis)
  - Treatment: Containment surgery if young

**Catterall Classification** (Historic)
- Groups I-IV based on extent of femoral head involvement
- Less reliable, observer-dependent

**Stulberg Classification** (Final Outcome)
- Based on femoral head shape at skeletal maturity
- **Class I**: Normal
- **Class II**: Spherical head, abnormal neck or acetabulum
- **Class III**: Ovoid/mushroom head (aspherical, congruent)
- **Class IV**: Flat head (aspherical, incongruent)
- **Class V**: Flat head + acetabular dysplasia (worst)
- **Classes I-II**: Low osteoarthritis risk
- **Classes III-V**: High osteoarthritis risk

### Prognostic Factors

**Good Prognosis**
- Young age at onset (<6 years, especially <4)
- Lateral Pillar A or B
- Minimal involvement (<50% femoral head)
- Female sex
- Full range of motion maintained

**Poor Prognosis**
- Older age at onset (>8 years, especially >10)
- Lateral Pillar C
- Extensive involvement (>50% femoral head)
- Male sex
- Loss of motion (especially abduction)
- "Head-at-risk" signs (see below)

**Head-at-Risk Signs (Catterall)**
- Gage sign: Lateral physeal radiolucency
- Lateral calcification
- Lateral subluxation
- Horizontal physis (poor remodeling potential)
- Metaphyseal cysts

### Treatment

**Observation**

**Indications**
- Age <6 years, any Lateral Pillar group
- Lateral Pillar A, any age
- Lateral Pillar B, age <8 years, full ROM

**Protocol**
- Activity modification: Avoid high-impact activities
- NSAIDs for pain
- Physical therapy: Maintain ROM (especially abduction, internal rotation)
- Serial radiographs every 3-4 months

**Containment Treatment**

**Goal**: Maintain femoral head within acetabulum during healing to promote spherical remodeling

**Indications**
- Age >6 years, Lateral Pillar B or C
- Loss of motion (abduction <30°)
- Lateral subluxation

**Non-Operative Containment**
- **Petrie casting**: Bilateral hip spica casts in abduction
  - Rarely used (immobilization, school absence)
- **Bracing**: Abduction orthoses
  - Limited evidence, compliance issues

**Operative Containment**
- **Femoral varus osteotomy**:
  - Varus angulation of proximal femur
  - Contains femoral head in acetabulum
  - Addresses spherical incongruency
  - Requires later hardware removal

- **Pelvic osteotomy (Salter, shelf)**:
  - Redirect acetabulum to cover femoral head
  - Avoids femur shortening

- **Combined osteotomy**: Femoral + pelvic (severe cases)

**Shelf Procedure**
- Create buttress above femoral head
- Salvage for lateral subluxation, older children

**Surgical Timing**
- Fragmentation or early reossification stage
- Before significant deformity develops

### Complications

**Femoral Head Deformity**
- Flattening, enlargement, aspherical shape
- **Hinge abduction**: Impingement during abduction (poor prognosis)

**Early Osteoarthritis**
- Stulberg III-V: 50-80% develop OA by age 50

**Leg Length Discrepancy**
- Mild (1-2 cm), usually well-tolerated

### Outcomes

- **Young age (<6 years)**: 80-90% good outcomes regardless of treatment
- **Older age (>8 years)**: 50-60% poor outcomes despite treatment
- **Stulberg I-II**: Normal or near-normal function, low OA risk
- **Stulberg III-V**: Activity limitations, high OA risk (may require THA in adulthood)

## Slipped Capital Femoral Epiphysis (SCFE)

### Definition and Epidemiology

**Definition**
- Displacement of the proximal femoral epiphysis (capital femoral epiphysis) relative to the metaphysis
- Occurs through the physis (growth plate)
- **Epiphysis remains in acetabulum; metaphysis displaces anteriorly and externally rotates**

**Incidence**
- 10 per 100,000 children
- Peak age: 10-16 years (girls earlier than boys)
- Male predominance (1.5:1)
- Bilateral in 20-40% (may be sequential)

**Risk Factors**
- **Obesity** (BMI >95th percentile): Most significant risk factor (80%)
- African American or Pacific Islander descent
- Male sex
- Endocrine disorders: Hypothyroidism, growth hormone deficiency, hypogonadism
- Renal osteodystrophy
- Radiation therapy

### Pathophysiology

**Mechanism**
- Shear stress through proximal femoral physis
- Physis weakened during rapid growth
- **Direction**: Posterior and inferior displacement of epiphysis (or anterior and superior displacement of metaphysis)

**Etiologic Factors**
- Increased BMI → increased shear forces
- Puberty → physeal widening and weakening
- Obesity-related hormonal changes (leptin, adipokines)
- Endocrine disorders → delayed physeal closure, prolonged risk period

### Classification

**By Onset**
- **Acute**: Symptoms <3 weeks, sudden onset, usually traumatic
- **Chronic**: Symptoms >3 weeks, gradual onset
- **Acute-on-chronic**: Chronic symptoms with sudden worsening

**By Stability (Most Important for Prognosis)**
- **Stable**: Able to bear weight (with or without crutches)
- **Unstable**: Unable to bear weight
  - **AVN risk**: Stable (0-5%), Unstable (10-50%)

**By Severity (Southwick Angle)**
- **Mild**: <30° slip angle
- **Moderate**: 30-50°
- **Severe**: >50°

**Southwick Slip Angle Calculation**
- Frog-leg lateral radiograph
- Angle between femoral neck axis and epiphyseal line
- Compare to contralateral side

### Clinical Presentation

**Symptoms**
- Hip, groin, thigh, or knee pain (referred)
- Limp (Trendelenburg or antalgic)
- Inability to bear weight (unstable SCFE)
- Decreased activity level

**Physical Examination**
- **Obligate external rotation**: Hip externally rotates with flexion (pathognomonic)
- Decreased internal rotation and abduction (most sensitive finding)
- Leg appears shortened and externally rotated
- Pain with range of motion
- **Drehmann sign**: External rotation and abduction with passive hip flexion

**Acute Unstable SCFE**
- Severe pain, muscle spasm
- Unable to bear weight
- Exam limited by pain

### Diagnostic Evaluation

**Radiographs**
- **AP and frog-leg lateral pelvis** (bilateral views)
- **Key findings**:
  - **Klein line** (AP view): Line along superior femoral neck should intersect epiphysis
    - **Positive Trethowan sign**: Line does not intersect epiphysis (slip present)
  - **Blanch sign** (AP view): Increased density at metaphysis (overlapping bone)
  - Frog-leg lateral: Posterior displacement of epiphysis clearly visible
  - Widened physis
  - Metaphyseal remodeling (chronic slip)

**Imaging Pearls**
- Always image contralateral hip (bilateral involvement 20-40%)
- Frog-leg lateral may worsen displacement in acute unstable SCFE (use cross-table lateral instead)

**MRI**
- Not routinely needed
- Pre-slip condition (physeal widening, edema)
- AVN evaluation

### Treatment

**Goals**
- Prevent further displacement
- Allow physeal closure
- Minimize AVN risk
- Restore function

**Non-Operative**
- **None**: All SCFE require surgical stabilization
- Bed rest until surgery

**Surgical Treatment: In Situ Fixation** (Gold Standard)

**Indications**
- All SCFE (stable and unstable)

**Technique**
- Single cannulated screw fixation
- Placed percutaneously in center of femoral head
- Perpendicular to physis
- Threads cross physis
- **Do not reduce slip** (increases AVN risk, especially unstable)
- Position: Supine, fracture table

**Screw Placement**
- Starting point: Anterior and lateral proximal femur
- Trajectory: Slight valgus, anteversion
- Endpoint: Center-center or inferior-central femoral head
- Avoid penetration into joint

**Postoperative Management**
- **Stable SCFE**: Weight-bearing as tolerated immediately
- **Unstable SCFE**: Protected weight-bearing 4-6 weeks
- Follow-up: Radiographs at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, then annually until physeal closure
- Monitor contralateral hip (risk of bilateral involvement)

**Prophylactic Contralateral Fixation**

**Controversial**
- **Arguments for**: 20-40% bilateral risk, morbidity of second slip
- **Arguments against**: Exposes 60-80% to unnecessary surgery, complication risk

**Indications for Contralateral Fixation**
- Age <10 years (highest bilateral risk)
- Endocrine disorder
- Open triradiate cartilage (significant growth remaining)
- Non-compliance concerns

**Reduction and Osteotomy**

**Indications** (controversial)
- **Severe slip** (>60°), chronic
- Significant functional impairment
- Femoroacetabular impingement

**Techniques**
- **Modified Dunn procedure**: Surgical hip dislocation, reduction, fixation
- **Femoral osteotomy**: Intertrochanteric or subtrochanteric
  - Correct deformity at metaphysis, not physis

**Risks**
- AVN risk (10-30%)
- Reserved for experienced surgeons, selected cases

### Complications

**Avascular Necrosis (AVN)**
- **Incidence**: Stable (0-5%), Unstable (10-50%), Reduction (10-30%)
- **Mechanism**: Disruption of blood supply (lateral epiphyseal vessels)
- **Prevention**: Avoid reduction, gentle manipulation, anatomic fixation
- **Treatment**: Salvage procedures (core decompression, osteotomy, arthroplasty)

**Chondrolysis**
- Acute cartilage necrosis, joint space narrowing
- **Risk factors**: Unstable slip, screw penetration into joint, multiple screws, cast immobilization
- **Presentation**: Pain, stiffness (loss of ROM)
- **Treatment**: PT, NSAIDs; poor prognosis

**Femoroacetabular Impingement (FAI)**
- **Cam-type impingement**: Metaphyseal prominence contacts acetabulum
- Chronic hip pain, limited motion
- May lead to labral tears, early OA
- Treatment: Osteoplasty vs. osteotomy

**Slip Progression**
- <2% after in situ fixation
- More common if inadequate fixation

**Hardware Complications**
- Screw penetration into joint (chondrolysis risk)
- Prominent hardware (irritation)
- Screw breakage (rare)

### Outcomes

**Stable SCFE**
- Excellent outcomes with in situ fixation (>90%)
- Pain relief, return to activities
- Mild/moderate slips: Good long-term function

**Unstable SCFE**
- AVN risk significantly impacts outcomes
- No AVN: Good outcomes
- AVN: Poor outcomes, early OA, salvage surgery

**Severe Slips**
- Increased risk of FAI, OA (long-term)
- May require osteotomy

**Bilateral Involvement**
- Second side typically within 18 months of first
- Overall outcomes depend on management of both hips

## Pediatric Fractures: Unique Considerations

### Pediatric Bone Characteristics

**Differences from Adult Bone**
- **Higher porosity**: More flexible, lower elastic modulus
- **Thicker periosteum**: Acts as hinge, aids in reduction and stability
- **Active physis**: Risk of growth arrest

**Fracture Patterns Unique to Children**
- **Plastic deformation**: Bone bends without fracture line
- **Torus (buckle) fracture**: Compression failure, cortex buckles
- **Greenstick fracture**: Incomplete fracture, cortex broken one side, bent on other

### Remodeling Potential

**Principles**
- Greater remodeling in younger children
- Better remodeling in plane of adjacent joint motion
- Better remodeling if deformity near physis (greatest growth potential)
- Rotational deformity does NOT remodel

**Acceptable Angulation Guidelines (Vary by Age, Location)**
- **Distal radius (age 10)**:
  - Bayonet apposition: Acceptable (fully remodels)
  - Angulation: 20-30° acceptable
- **Femoral shaft (age 8)**:
  - Angulation: 15-20° (sagittal), 10° (coronal)
  - Shortening: 2 cm acceptable (overgrowth compensates)

### Physeal Injuries

**Salter-Harris Classification**

**Type I**: Through physis only
- **Mechanism**: Shear force
- **Radiograph**: Often normal, or widened physis
- **Diagnosis**: Clinical (pain, tenderness at physis)
- **Treatment**: Immobilization
- **Prognosis**: Excellent, rare growth arrest

**Type II**: Through physis and metaphysis (Metaphyseal fragment)
- **Most common** (75%)
- **"Thurmston-Holland fragment"**: Metaphyseal corner
- **Treatment**: Closed reduction typically, may need pinning
- **Prognosis**: Good, rare growth arrest

**Type III**: Through physis and epiphysis (Epiphyseal fragment)
- **Intra-articular fracture**
- **Treatment**: Anatomic reduction (open reduction internal fixation often needed)
- **Prognosis**: Risk of growth arrest, arthritis if not anatomically reduced

**Type IV**: Through metaphysis, physis, and epiphysis
- **Intra-articular, crosses all zones**
- **Treatment**: ORIF for anatomic reduction
- **Prognosis**: High risk of growth arrest (25-50%), arthritis

**Type V**: Crush injury to physis
- **Rare, difficult to diagnose acutely**
- **Mechanism**: Axial compression
- **Radiograph**: May be normal initially
- **Prognosis**: Poor, growth arrest common (diagnosed retrospectively)

**Mnemonic**: SALTR
- **S**lip (Type I)
- **A**bove (Type II - metaphysis above physis)
- **L**ower (Type III - epiphysis lower/below physis)
- **T**hrough (Type IV - through all layers)
- **R**ammed/Crushed (Type V)

**Growth Arrest**
- **Partial arrest (bar formation)**: Angular deformity
- **Complete arrest**: Limb-length discrepancy
- **Treatment**: Bar excision (if <50% of physis), limb lengthening, epiphysiodesis of contralateral side

### Common Pediatric Fractures

**Supracondylar Humerus Fracture**
- Most common elbow fracture in children (peak age 5-7 years)
- **Mechanism**: Fall on outstretched hand (FOOSH), elbow hyperextension
- **Complications**:
  - **Neurovascular injury**: Anterior interosseous nerve (most common), radial nerve, brachial artery
  - **Volkmann contracture**: Compartment syndrome → ischemic contracture
  - **Cubitus varus** (malunion): Cosmetic, usually non-functional
- **Treatment**:
  - Non-displaced: Casting
  - Displaced: Closed reduction and percutaneous pinning (CRPP)

**Forearm Fractures (Both-Bone)**
- Common in school-age children
- **Treatment**: Closed reduction and casting (most), ORIF if unstable or open
- **Remodeling**: Excellent, especially if near distal radius physis

**Femoral Shaft Fracture**
- **Age <6 months**: Rule out non-accidental trauma
- **Treatment**:
  - Age 0-5 years: Spica cast (immediate or after traction)
  - Age 6-10 years: Flexible intramedullary nails
  - Age >11 years: Rigid intramedullary nail (avoid physis)
- **Overgrowth**: 1-2 cm of shortening acceptable (compensates with overgrowth)

## Key Points

1. **Developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH)** risk factors include female sex, breech presentation, first-born, and family history; early diagnosis and treatment with Pavlik harness (<6 months) results in excellent outcomes.

2. **Barlow and Ortolani maneuvers** are used to detect DDH in newborns; ultrasound is the imaging modality of choice for infants <4-6 months, radiographs after ossification of femoral head.

3. **Clubfoot** is treated with the Ponseti method (serial casting + Achilles tenotomy + bracing); compliance with bracing (until age 4-5 years) is critical to prevent recurrence.

4. **Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease** is avascular necrosis of the femoral head in children; prognosis depends on age at onset (<6 years better), extent of involvement (Lateral Pillar classification), and maintenance of femoral head containment.

5. **Slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE)** is strongly associated with obesity; classification by stability (stable vs. unstable) is most important prognostic factor for AVN risk.

6. **In situ fixation** with a single screw is the standard treatment for SCFE; reduction should be avoided (increases AVN risk), especially in unstable slips.

7. **Salter-Harris classification** describes physeal fractures; Types III and IV are intra-articular and require anatomic reduction to prevent growth arrest and arthritis.

8. **Pediatric bone remodeling potential** is greatest in younger children, near physis, and in plane of adjacent joint motion; rotational deformity does NOT remodel.

9. **Supracondylar humerus fractures** are at risk for neurovascular complications (anterior interosseous nerve injury most common) and compartment syndrome (Volkmann contracture).

10. **Avascular necrosis (AVN)** is the most serious complication of DDH (treatment-related), SCFE (unstable slips), and Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease (inherent to disease); prevention strategies and early recognition are critical.
