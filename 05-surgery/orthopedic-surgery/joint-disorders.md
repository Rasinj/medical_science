# Joint Disorders

## Overview

Joint disorders encompass a wide range of pathologies affecting synovial joints, including degenerative, inflammatory, infectious, and traumatic conditions. Arthritis is the most common indication for joint surgery, with arthroplasty (joint replacement) representing one of the most successful surgical interventions in modern medicine. Understanding the pathophysiology, indications, and technical aspects of joint surgery is essential for optimal patient outcomes.

## Osteoarthritis

### Pathophysiology

**Cartilage Degeneration**
- Progressive loss of articular cartilage
- Subchondral bone sclerosis and cyst formation
- Osteophyte formation at joint margins
- Synovial inflammation and effusion
- Loss of joint space on radiographs

**Risk Factors**
- Age (>50 years)
- Obesity (BMI >30)
- Previous joint injury or surgery
- Genetic predisposition
- Mechanical malalignment (varus/valgus deformity)
- Occupational repetitive stress

**Primary vs. Secondary**
- **Primary**: Idiopathic, age-related
- **Secondary**: Post-traumatic, developmental dysplasia, inflammatory arthritis, avascular necrosis

### Clinical Presentation

**Symptoms**
- Joint pain: Worsens with activity, improves with rest
- Morning stiffness: <30 minutes (vs. >1 hour in inflammatory arthritis)
- Reduced range of motion
- Crepitus with movement
- Joint instability or "giving way"
- Night pain (advanced disease)

**Physical Examination**
- Joint line tenderness
- Reduced range of motion
- Crepitus on passive movement
- Joint effusion
- Deformity: Varus (bowleg) or valgus (knock-knee)
- Muscle atrophy in chronic disease
- Antalgic gait

### Diagnostic Evaluation

**Radiographic Findings**
- Joint space narrowing
- Subchondral sclerosis
- Osteophyte formation
- Subchondral cysts
- Malalignment

**Advanced Imaging**
- **MRI**: Cartilage evaluation, bone marrow edema, meniscal tears
- **CT**: Bony anatomy, preoperative planning
- **Standing films**: Weight-bearing alignment studies

**Laboratory Tests**
- Generally normal in primary OA
- ESR/CRP: Rule out inflammatory arthritis
- Rheumatoid factor, Anti-CCP: Rule out RA
- Joint aspiration: Rule out infection or crystal arthropathy

### Non-Operative Management

**Conservative Measures**
- Weight loss (if BMI >25)
- Physical therapy and strengthening
- Activity modification
- Assistive devices (cane, walker)
- Bracing for unloader support

**Pharmacologic Treatment**
- Acetaminophen: First-line for mild pain
- NSAIDs: Short-term use, monitor renal/GI effects
- Topical NSAIDs: For superficial joints (knee, hand)
- Intra-articular corticosteroid injections: Temporary relief
- Viscosupplementation (hyaluronic acid): Controversial efficacy

## Total Hip Arthroplasty (THA)

### Indications

**Primary Indications**
- Osteoarthritis with failed conservative management
- Avascular necrosis of femoral head
- Inflammatory arthritis (rheumatoid, psoriatic)

### Preoperative Assessment

**Medical Optimization**
- Cardiac clearance for high-risk patients
- Glycemic control: HbA1c <8% (preferably <7%)
- Smoking cessation: Minimum 4 weeks preoperatively
- Weight loss if BMI >40
- Dental clearance (eliminate infection sources)
- Nutritional assessment: Albumin >3.5 g/dL

**Infection Screening**

**Templating**
- Digital or analog templating
- Determine implant size and position
- Assess leg length discrepancy
- Plan for offset and version

### Surgical Approaches

**Posterior Approach**
- **Advantages**: Familiar anatomy, extensile, lower dislocation risk with capsular repair
- **Disadvantages**: Risk to sciatic nerve, posterior soft tissue disruption
- **Technique**: Patient lateral, incision centered over greater trochanter, split gluteus maximus, divide short external rotators
- **Dislocation precautions**: Avoid flexion >90°, adduction, internal rotation

**Direct Anterior Approach (DAA)**
- **Advantages**: Internervous plane, faster recovery, lower dislocation risk
- **Disadvantages**: Learning curve, risk to lateral femoral cutaneous nerve, fracture risk
- **Technique**: Patient supine, incision 2-3 cm lateral to ASIS, interval between TFL and sartorius
- **Dislocation precautions**: Avoid extension, external rotation, adduction

**Anterolateral Approach**
- **Advantages**: Stable, low dislocation risk
- **Disadvantages**: Trendelenburg gait (abductor damage)
- **Technique**: Incision centered over greater trochanter, split gluteus medius

**Direct Lateral (Hardinge) Approach**
- **Advantages**: Excellent exposure, stable
- **Disadvantages**: Abductor damage, Trendelenburg risk
- **Technique**: Incision centered over greater trochanter, split gluteus medius from anterior portion

### Implant Selection

**Bearing Surfaces**
- **Metal-on-Polyethylene**: Most common, proven track record, polyethylene wear
- **Ceramic-on-Polyethylene**: Lower wear, ceramic fracture risk (rare)
- **Ceramic-on-Ceramic**: Lowest wear, squeaking (1-3%), fracture risk
- **Metal-on-Metal**: Largely abandoned due to metallosis and adverse local tissue reactions

**Femoral Fixation**
- **Cemented**: Older patients, osteoporotic bone, immediate weight-bearing
- **Uncemented**: Younger patients, good bone quality, biological fixation
- **Hybrid**: Cemented femoral stem, uncemented acetabular component

**Head Size**
- Larger heads (36mm, 40mm): Lower dislocation risk, increased range of motion
- Smaller heads (28mm, 32mm): Lower volumetric wear, more options for dual mobility

**Dual Mobility**
- Two articulations: Large outer head, small inner head
- Significantly reduced dislocation risk
- Indication: High-risk patients (neuromuscular disorders, revision, fracture)

### Surgical Technique

**Acetabular Preparation**
- Expose acetabulum, remove labrum and osteophytes
- Ream to bleeding subchondral bone
- Achieve 40-45° inclination, 15-20° anteversion
- Press-fit cup (uncemented) or cement (cemented)
- Screw fixation if needed for stability

**Femoral Preparation**
- Femoral neck osteotomy: Templated level and angle
- Open femoral canal with box chisel or awl
- Broach incrementally to desired size
- Trial stem, check stability and leg length
- Final stem insertion (cementless: press-fit; cemented: cement technique)

**Reconstruction**
- Trial reduction: Check stability, range of motion, leg length
- Insert final components
- Reduce hip
- Repair capsule and short external rotators (posterior approach)
- Layered closure

### Postoperative Management

**Immediate Postoperative Care**
- Pain control: Multimodal analgesia, minimize opioids
- DVT prophylaxis: Aspirin, LMWH, or anticoagulation (35 days)
- Antibiotics: Perioperative only (24 hours)
- Wound care: Sterile dressing, monitor for drainage

**Rehabilitation**
- Physical therapy: Day of surgery or POD #1
- Weight-bearing: As tolerated (most modern approaches)
- Hip precautions: Approach-dependent, typically 6-12 weeks
- Progressive strengthening and range of motion

**Dislocation Precautions**
- **Posterior approach**: Avoid hip flexion >90°, adduction, internal rotation
- **Anterior approach**: Avoid extension, external rotation, adduction
- **Duration**: 6-12 weeks, longer for high-risk patients

**Functional Recovery Timeline**
- **2 weeks**: Independent ambulation with assistive device
- **6 weeks**: Discontinue assistive device, return to sedentary work
- **3 months**: Return to most activities, recreational sports
- **6-12 months**: Maximal improvement in pain and function

### Complications

**Intraoperative Complications**
- **Fracture**: Acetabulum or femur (0.1-1%)
  - Treatment: Fixation with cerclage wires, cables, or plates
- **Vascular injury**: Rare, more common with anterior approach
- **Nerve injury**: Sciatic nerve (posterior), femoral/lateral femoral cutaneous (anterior)

**Early Postoperative Complications (0-6 weeks)**
- **Dislocation** (1-3%):
  - Risk factors: Posterior approach, neuromuscular disorders, component malposition
  - Treatment: Closed reduction, bracing; recurrent dislocations may require revision
- **Infection** (0.5-2%):
  - Acute: Within 3 months, aggressive organisms (S. aureus, gram-negatives)
  - Treatment: Irrigation and debridement, modular component exchange, antibiotics
- **Venous thromboembolism** (1-2% with prophylaxis):
  - DVT: Calf or proximal, may be asymptomatic
  - PE: Rare but potentially fatal
  - Prevention: Chemoprophylaxis, mechanical devices, early mobilization

**Late Complications (>6 weeks)**
- **Aseptic loosening**:
  - Causes: Osteolysis from polyethylene wear particles
  - Presentation: Pain, component migration on radiographs
  - Treatment: Revision arthroplasty
- **Periprosthetic fracture**:
  - Around femoral stem (Vancouver classification) or acetabulum
  - Treatment: Fracture fixation ± component revision
- **Leg length discrepancy**:
  - Acceptable: <10 mm
  - Prevention: Intraoperative assessment, templating
- **Heterotopic ossification**:
  - Bone formation in soft tissues around hip
  - Prevention: NSAIDs (indomethacin) or radiation (high-risk patients)
  - Treatment: Excision if symptomatic and mature

## Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA)

### Indications

**Primary Indications**
- Osteoarthritis with failed conservative management
- Inflammatory arthritis (rheumatoid, psoriatic)
- Post-traumatic arthritis
- Avascular necrosis
- Painful bone-on-bone arthritis

**Contraindications**
- **Absolute**: Active infection, extensor mechanism dysfunction
- **Relative**: Peripheral vascular disease, neuropathic joint, severe obesity (BMI >40)

### Preoperative Planning

**Assessment**
- Standing AP and lateral knee radiographs
- Long-leg alignment films (hip-knee-ankle)
- Mechanical axis: Assess varus/valgus deformity
- Patella views: Assess patellofemoral arthritis
- Flexion/extension contracture assessment

**Templating**
- Determine implant size
- Plan for bone cuts and alignment
- Assess for augments or stems

### Surgical Technique

**Approach**
- **Medial parapatellar**: Most common, provides excellent exposure
- **Midvastus**: Spares quadriceps tendon, faster recovery
- **Subvastus**: Preserves quadriceps, limited exposure
- **Lateral**: For valgus deformities

**Bone Preparation**
- **Femoral cuts**: Distal, anterior, posterior, chamfer
  - Goal: 5-7° valgus, restore joint line, maintain flexion-extension gap balance
- **Tibial cut**: Perpendicular to mechanical axis (0-3° posterior slope)
  - Goal: Resect 8-10 mm from least-worn compartment
- **Patellar preparation**: Resect to 15-18 mm total thickness

**Balancing**
- **Extension gap**: Distal femoral and tibial cuts
- **Flexion gap**: Posterior femoral cuts
- **Goal**: Rectangular, equal gaps in flexion and extension
- **Techniques**: Measured resection vs. gap balancing

**Implant Fixation**
- **Cemented**: Standard, provides immediate fixation
- **Uncemented**: Limited use, requires bone ingrowth
- **Hybrid**: Typically not used in TKA

**Patellar Resurfacing**
- **Arguments for**: Improves outcomes, reduces anterior knee pain
- **Arguments against**: Adds operative time, complication risk
- **Consensus**: Surgeon-dependent, patient-specific factors

### Implant Design

**Constraint Levels**
- **Cruciate-retaining (CR)**: Preserves PCL, more physiologic kinematics
- **Posterior-stabilized (PS)**: Sacrifices PCL, cam-post mechanism, better for flexion contracture
- **Constrained**: For severe instability or bone loss
- **Hinged**: Salvage, severe bone loss, tumor reconstruction

**Fixed vs. Mobile Bearing**
- **Fixed**: Standard, proven track record
- **Mobile**: Rotating platform, theoretical reduced wear (not proven clinically)

### Postoperative Management

**Immediate Care**
- Multimodal pain control: Peripheral nerve blocks, local infiltration analgesia
- DVT prophylaxis: Aspirin vs. LMWH (35 days)
- Continuous passive motion (CPM): Optional, not proven beneficial
- Cryotherapy: Reduces swelling and pain

**Rehabilitation**
- Immediate weight-bearing as tolerated
- Range of motion exercises: Begin POD #0 or #1
- Progressive strengthening
- Goal: 0° extension, 120° flexion

**Discharge Planning**
- Home with PT vs. acute rehabilitation facility
- Assistive devices: Walker, cane
- Hip precautions not required

**Recovery Milestones**
- **2 weeks**: Independent ambulation
- **6 weeks**: Return to sedentary work, driving
- **3 months**: Return to recreational activities
- **6-12 months**: Maximal improvement

### Complications

**Intraoperative**
- **Fracture**: Femur, tibia, patella
  - Treatment: Fixation, may require stemmed components
- **Ligament injury**: MCL, LCL
  - Treatment: Repair vs. more constrained implant

**Early Postoperative**
- **Stiffness/Arthrofibrosis**:
  - Risk factors: Preoperative stiffness, prolonged immobilization
  - Prevention: Early aggressive PT
  - Treatment: Manipulation under anesthesia (within 12 weeks), arthroscopic lysis of adhesions
- **Infection** (0.5-2%):
  - Acute (<3 months): I&D, component retention or exchange
  - Chronic (>3 months): Two-stage revision
- **Instability**:
  - Causes: Component malposition, inadequate soft tissue balancing
  - Treatment: Bracing, revision to more constrained implant
- **Periprosthetic fracture**:
  - Supracondylar femur fracture most common
  - Treatment: ORIF vs. revision to stemmed component

**Long-Term**
- **Aseptic loosening**: Polyethylene wear, osteolysis
- **Polyethylene wear**: Requires revision
- **Patellar complications**: Fracture, maltracking, loosening, clunk syndrome
- **Periprosthetic joint infection (PJI)**: Requires two-stage revision typically

## Shoulder Arthroplasty

### Indications

**Total Shoulder Arthroplasty (TSA)**
- Osteoarthritis with intact rotator cuff
- Inflammatory arthritis
- Avascular necrosis
- Post-traumatic arthritis

**Reverse Total Shoulder Arthroplasty (RTSA)**

- Irreparable massive rotator cuff tears with arthritis
- Failed hemiarthroplasty or TSA
- Complex proximal humerus fractures (elderly)
- Revision arthroplasty

### Anatomic vs. Reverse Shoulder Arthroplasty

**Anatomic TSA**
- Replaces humeral head and glenoid
- Requires intact rotator cuff
- More physiologic motion
- Better range of motion
- Lower complication rate

**Reverse TSA**
- Reverses ball-and-socket: Glenosphere and humeral liner
- Does not require rotator cuff
- Deltoid becomes primary mover
- Limited external rotation
- Higher complication rate (dislocation, scapular notching)

### Surgical Technique

**Approach**
- **Deltopectoral**: Most common, internervous plane
- **Superior approach**: For RTSA, better glenoid exposure

**Humeral Preparation**
- Osteotomy at anatomic neck (TSA) or slightly lower (RTSA)
- Ream and broach to appropriate size
- Version: 20-40° retroversion (TSA)

**Glenoid Preparation**
- Expose glenoid, remove labrum
- Ream to subchondral bone
- Correct version and inclination
- Cemented fixation (TSA) or baseplate + screws (RTSA)

**Reconstruction**
- Insert final components
- Trial reduction: Check stability, range of motion
- Repair subscapularis tendon

### Postoperative Management

**Immobilization**
- Sling for 4-6 weeks
- Passive range of motion only initially
- Active range of motion at 6 weeks
- Strengthening at 12 weeks

**Rehabilitation Goals**
- Pain relief (primary goal)
- Forward elevation: 120-140° (TSA), 90-120° (RTSA)
- External rotation: 30-40° (TSA), limited (RTSA)

### Complications

- **Instability/Dislocation**: Higher in RTSA (2-10%)
- **Infection**: 1-2%
- **Nerve injury**: Axillary nerve (deltoid denervation)
- **Component loosening**: Glenoid loosening more common in TSA
- **Scapular notching**: RTSA-specific, polyethylene impingement on scapula
- **Periprosthetic fracture**: Humeral shaft fracture

## Revision Arthroplasty

**Instability/Dislocation**
- Recurrent dislocations despite conservative management
- Component malposition
- Soft tissue insufficiency

**Periprosthetic Fracture**
- Fracture around prosthesis
- May require fixation ± component revision

**Implant Failure**
- Polyethylene wear
- Component fracture (rare)

### Preoperative Assessment

- Uncemented components: Risk of bone loss during extraction
- Specialized extraction tools: Gigli saws, osteotomes, trephines

**Soft Tissue Deficiency**
- Abductor insufficiency (hip): Constrained liner, dual mobility
- Extensor mechanism insufficiency (knee): Allograft reconstruction, linked implants

### Outcomes

**Success Rates**
- Lower than primary arthroplasty
- 10-year survival: 80-90% (revision THA), 70-85% (revision TKA)

**Re-revision Risk**
- Higher than primary failure risk
- Dependent on indication: Infection highest re-revision rate

## Inflammatory Arthritis

### Rheumatoid Arthritis

**Joint Involvement**
- Symmetric polyarthritis
- Hands, wrists, knees, ankles, cervical spine
- Joint destruction, subluxation, deformity

**Surgical Considerations**

- 15-year survival: 85-90%
- Failure more common in younger, more active patients

**Functional Outcomes**
- Pain relief: 80-90% satisfied
- Range of motion: 0-120° average
- Patient satisfaction: 80-85% (lower than THA)

**Factors Affecting Satisfaction**
- Preoperative expectations
- Pain catastrophizing
- Depression and anxiety
- Surgical technique and alignment

### Shoulder Arthroplasty

**Survivorship**
- TSA 10-year survival: 90-95%
- RTSA 10-year survival: 85-90%

**Functional Outcomes**
- Pain relief: Excellent (primary goal)
- Range of motion: Variable, better with TSA
- Function: Activities of daily living significantly improved

## Key Points

1. **Osteoarthritis** is the most common indication for arthroplasty; conservative management should be optimized before surgery.

2. **Total hip arthroplasty** is one of the most successful operations, with excellent pain relief and functional outcomes; approach selection depends on surgeon experience and patient factors.

3. **Total knee arthroplasty** provides good pain relief but lower satisfaction rates than THA; proper alignment and soft tissue balancing are critical.

4. **Bearing surfaces** in THA: Metal-on-polyethylene remains the gold standard; ceramic-on-ceramic has lowest wear but risk of squeaking and fracture.

5. **Dislocation risk** in THA is approach-dependent; posterior approach has higher risk without capsular repair; dual mobility reduces risk significantly.

6. **Periprosthetic joint infection** is a devastating complication requiring prolonged treatment; acute infections may be treated with component retention, while chronic infections typically require two-stage revision.

7. **Revision arthroplasty** is more complex than primary surgery due to bone loss, soft tissue deficiency, and component extraction challenges.

8. **Inflammatory arthritis** patients require special consideration including medication management, infection risk, and bone quality assessment.

9. **Reverse total shoulder arthroplasty** has expanded indications for rotator cuff deficiency; provides excellent pain relief but limited range of motion.

10. **Patient optimization** is essential for success: glycemic control, smoking cessation, weight loss, and infection screening reduce complications.
