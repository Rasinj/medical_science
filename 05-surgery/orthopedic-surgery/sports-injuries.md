# Sports Injuries

## Overview

Sports medicine encompasses the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of injuries sustained during athletic activities. These injuries range from acute traumatic events to chronic overuse conditions affecting bones, joints, ligaments, tendons, and muscles. Understanding injury mechanisms, biomechanics, and surgical reconstruction techniques is essential for returning athletes to their preinjury level of function. Modern arthroscopic techniques have revolutionized the treatment of many sports injuries, allowing for minimally invasive repair and faster recovery.

## Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) Injuries

### Anatomy and Biomechanics

**ACL Structure**
- Origin: Posteromedial aspect of lateral femoral condyle
- Insertion: Anterior tibial plateau (anterior to tibial eminence)
- Two functional bundles:
  - **Anteromedial (AM)**: Tight in flexion, controls anterior tibial translation
  - **Posterolateral (PL)**: Tight in extension, controls rotational stability
- Blood supply: Middle genicular artery (poor healing potential)

**Function**
- Primary restraint to anterior tibial translation (85%)
- Secondary restraint to internal rotation and varus/valgus stress
- Proprioceptive function (mechanoreceptors)

### Injury Mechanism

**Non-Contact Injuries (70%)**
- Deceleration with cutting or pivoting
- Hyperextension
- Landing from jump with knee near full extension
- **"Position of no return"**: Knee valgus + external rotation + anterior tibial translation

**Contact Injuries (30%)**
- Direct blow to lateral knee (valgus stress)
- Dashboard injury (posterior tibial force)

**Risk Factors**
- Female sex (2-8x higher risk)
  - Hormonal influences, anatomic factors (Q-angle, notch width)
  - Neuromuscular control differences
- Previous ACL injury (contralateral or ipsilateral)
- Familial predisposition
- Sport-specific: Soccer, basketball, football, skiing

### Clinical Presentation

**Acute Symptoms**
- Audible "pop" at time of injury (50-70%)
- Immediate knee effusion (hemarthrosis within 2 hours)
- Instability sensation ("knee giving way")
- Unable to continue sports activity

**Physical Examination**
- **Lachman test**: Most sensitive (85-95%)
  - Patient supine, knee 20-30° flexion
  - Anterior translation of tibia with soft or absent endpoint
- **Anterior drawer test**: Less sensitive (50-70%)
  - Patient supine, knee 90° flexion, foot stabilized
  - Anterior tibial translation
- **Pivot shift test**: Most specific (95-98%)
  - Knee extended, valgus stress + internal rotation
  - Flexion produces palpable/visible reduction (subluxation)
- **Effusion**: Positive ballottement sign

**Associated Injuries**
- Meniscal tears (50%): Lateral meniscus (acute), medial meniscus (chronic)
- MCL injury (30%): "Terrible triad" (ACL + MCL + medial meniscus)
- Bone bruises: Lateral femoral condyle, posterior lateral tibial plateau
- Chondral injuries

### Diagnostic Evaluation

**Imaging**
- **Radiographs**: AP, lateral, Rosenberg, patellar views
  - Rule out fractures: Segond fracture (lateral capsular avulsion, pathognomonic)
  - Notch stenosis
- **MRI**: Gold standard (90-95% sensitivity/specificity)
  - Primary signs: ACL discontinuity, abnormal signal
  - Secondary signs: Anterior tibial translation (>7 mm), PCL angle <105°, bone bruises
  - Evaluate menisci, cartilage, collateral ligaments

**Classification**
- **Grade I**: Sprain, intact fibers, stable
- **Grade II**: Partial tear, some laxity
- **Grade III**: Complete tear, gross instability

### Non-Operative Management

**Indications**
- Low-demand patients (sedentary, elderly)
- Partial tears with minimal instability
- Children with open growth plates (relative)
- Medical contraindications to surgery

**Conservative Treatment**
- **Acute phase**: RICE (rest, ice, compression, elevation)
- Early range of motion
- Physical therapy: Quadriceps and hamstring strengthening
- Bracing: Functional ACL brace
- Activity modification: Avoid pivoting sports

**Natural History Without Surgery**
- 50% develop instability symptoms
- Increased risk of meniscal tears, cartilage damage, osteoarthritis

### Surgical Indications

**Relative Indications**
- Young, active patients
- Athletes returning to pivoting sports
- Associated repairable meniscal tear
- Multi-ligament injury
- Functionally unstable knee despite rehabilitation

**Timing**
- **Acute (<3 weeks)**: Risk of arthrofibrosis, allow swelling to resolve
- **Optimal**: 3-6 weeks post-injury
  - Full range of motion restored
  - Swelling resolved
  - Quadriceps strength improved
- **Chronic**: Anytime, assess for secondary pathology

### Surgical Technique: ACL Reconstruction

**Graft Selection**

**Autograft Options**
- **Bone-patellar tendon-bone (BPTB)**:
  - Advantages: Bone-to-bone healing (faster), high stiffness, low failure rates
  - Disadvantages: Anterior knee pain (30%), kneeling pain, patellar fracture risk
  - Best for: Young, high-demand athletes, contact sports

- **Hamstring tendon (Semitendinosus ± Gracilis)**:
  - Advantages: Less anterior knee pain, smaller incisions, cosmetic
  - Disadvantages: Hamstring weakness, slower graft incorporation, higher failure rates in young (<20 years)
  - Best for: Recreational athletes, females, patients with anterior knee pain

- **Quadriceps tendon**:
  - Advantages: Large graft, bone block option, low morbidity
  - Disadvantages: Less common, quadriceps weakness (temporary)
  - Best for: Revision, large patients, patient preference

**Allograft**
- Advantages: No donor site morbidity, faster surgery, multiple grafts (multi-ligament)
- Disadvantages: Higher failure rates (especially young, active), disease transmission risk (rare), cost
- Best for: Older patients (>40), revision, multi-ligament injuries

**Surgical Technique**

1. **Diagnostic Arthroscopy**
   - Confirm ACL tear
   - Evaluate and treat meniscal tears
   - Assess cartilage
   - Remove ACL remnant (debride to footprint)

2. **Graft Harvest and Preparation**
   - BPTB: 10 mm width, 25 mm bone blocks
   - Hamstring: Whipstitch ends, size 7-9 mm (quadruple strand)
   - Graft preparation table: Size, tension, pretension

3. **Tunnel Placement**
   - **Femoral tunnel**:
     - Anatomic AM bundle position: "Over-the-top" minus 2-3 mm
     - Transtibial vs. anteromedial portal technique
     - Goal: Restore native anatomy, avoid vertical graft
   - **Tibial tunnel**:
     - Center of ACL footprint, anterior to PCL
     - 50-55° sagittal angle
     - Avoid posterior wall blowout

4. **Graft Passage and Fixation**
   - Pass graft through tibial tunnel, into joint, through femoral tunnel
   - **Femoral fixation**: Button (EndoButton), interference screw, cross-pin
   - **Tibial fixation**: Interference screw, button
   - Tension graft with knee in 20-30° flexion, anterior drawer force
   - Cycle knee 20-30 times before final fixation

5. **Final Assessment**
   - Confirm stability: Lachman, anterior drawer
   - Full range of motion without impingement
   - No graft-roof impingement in extension

## Meniscal Injuries

### Anatomy and Function

**Meniscus Structure**
- **Medial meniscus**: "C-shaped," less mobile (capsular attachments)
- **Lateral meniscus**: "O-shaped," more mobile
- Composition: Fibrocartilage (Type I collagen)
- Zones:
  - **Red-red**: Peripheral 10-25%, vascular (healing potential)
  - **Red-white**: Middle 25-50%, partial vascularity
  - **White-white**: Central >50%, avascular (poor healing)

**Function**
- Load distribution (50-70% axial load)

- Older patients (>40 years)

### Tear Patterns

**Vertical Tears**
- **Longitudinal**: Parallel to circumferential fibers
- **Bucket-handle**: Large longitudinal tear with displaced fragment
  - Can cause locked knee (inability to fully extend)
- **Radial**: Perpendicular to circumferential fibers, disrupt hoop stress

**Horizontal Cleavage Tears**
- Degenerative, splits meniscus into superior and inferior leaves

**Complex Tears**
- Multiple tear patterns

**Root Tears**

  - Positive: Palpable/audible click or pain
- **Thessaly test**: Patient stands on one leg, rotates body with knee 20° flexion
- **Apley compression test**: Prone, knee 90° flexion, axial load + rotation
- **Effusion**: Variable

### Diagnostic Evaluation

**Imaging**
- **Radiographs**: AP, lateral, Rosenberg, patellar views
  - Rule out fracture, degenerative changes

**Technique**
- Partial meniscectomy: Remove only torn, unstable tissue
- Goal: Preserve as much meniscus as possible
- Smooth, stable rim

**Postoperative Protocol**
- Immediate weight-bearing as tolerated
- Early ROM and strengthening
- Return to sport: 4-8 weeks

**Outcomes**
- Short-term: Good pain relief, functional improvement
- Long-term: Increased risk of osteoarthritis (10-20 year follow-up)
- Total meniscectomy: 50-70% develop OA by 20 years

### Complications

- **Chronic**: Degenerative tear (older patients), insidious onset, night pain
- Pain: Lateral shoulder, radiates to deltoid insertion
- Weakness: Abduction, external rotation
- Night pain: Lying on affected shoulder

**Physical Examination**
- **Inspection**: Muscle atrophy (supraspinatus, infraspinatus)
- **Range of motion**:
  - Active vs. passive ROM
  - Loss of active abduction (large tears)
- **Strength testing**:
  - **Jobe test (Empty can)**: Supraspinatus (abduction 90°, 30° forward flexion, internal rotation)
  - **External rotation**: Infraspinatus, teres minor
  - **Lift-off test**: Subscapularis (hand behind back, push away)

**Advantages over Open**
- Less pain, smaller incisions
- Preserve deltoid attachment
- Treat intra-articular pathology
- Faster recovery

**Procedure**
1. **Diagnostic arthroscopy**
   - Assess tear size, pattern, quality of tissue, mobility
   - Evaluate biceps tendon, labrum, cartilage

2. **Subacromial decompression (if indicated)**
   - Bursectomy
   - Acromioplasty (if Type II or III acromion with impingement)

3. **Tendon mobilization**
   - Release adhesions
   - Assess tendon excursion and reducibility

4. **Bone preparation**
   - Debride greater tuberosity to bleeding bone
   - Create footprint for repair

5. **Anchor placement**
   - Medial row: Suture anchors at articular margin
   - Lateral row: Lateral footprint (double-row repair)

6. **Repair configuration**
   - **Single-row**: Anchors at footprint, sutures through tendon
   - **Double-row**: Medial row anchors + lateral row anchors (better contact pressure)
   - **Suture bridge**: Medial anchors, sutures passed to lateral anchors (biomechanically superior)

7. **Final assessment**
   - Tendon to bone apposition
   - No excessive tension

**Open Repair**
- Large, retracted tears
- Revision repairs
- Subscapularis tears

### Postoperative Management

**Immobilization (6 weeks)**
- Abduction sling or pillow
- Passive ROM only (therapist-assisted)
- Elbow, wrist, hand exercises

**Phase 2 (6-12 weeks)**
- Active-assisted ROM
- Gradual weaning from sling

**Phase 3 (3-6 months)**
- Active ROM, progressive strengthening
- Return to light activities

**Phase 4 (6-12 months)**
- Full strengthening
- Return to sports, overhead activities

### Complications

- **Retear** (10-40%): Higher with large/massive tears, poor tissue quality, non-compliance
- **Stiffness/Adhesive capsulitis** (5-10%): Prevention with early passive ROM
- **Infection** (<1%)
- **Deltoid detachment**: Open repairs (rare in arthroscopic)
- **Nerve injury**: Axillary nerve (deltoid denervation)

### Outcomes

- **Glenohumeral ligaments**: Superior, middle, inferior glenohumeral ligaments (IGHL most important)
- **Joint capsule**
- **Negative intra-articular pressure**

**Dynamic Stabilizers**
- **Rotator cuff**: Compresses humeral head into glenoid
- **Scapular stabilizers**: Serratus anterior, trapezius, rhomboids
- **Long head of biceps**: Minor stabilizer

### Classification

**By Direction**
- **Anterior** (95%): Most common
- **Posterior** (2-5%)
- **Multidirectional** (MDI)

**By Chronicity**
- **Acute**: First-time dislocation
- **Recurrent**: Multiple dislocations

**By Severity**
- **Dislocation**: Humeral head completely out of glenoid
- **Subluxation**: Partial displacement, spontaneous reduction

### Anterior Shoulder Instability

**Mechanism**
- Arm abduction + external rotation
- Fall on outstretched hand (FOOSH)
- Direct blow to posterior shoulder

**Pathoanatomy**
- **Bankart lesion**: Anteroinferior labral tear (essential lesion)
- **Hill-Sachs lesion**: Posterolateral humeral head compression fracture (70-90%)
- **Anterior capsular stretch or tear**
- **HAGL lesion**: Humeral avulsion of glenohumeral ligament (rare)

**Clinical Presentation**
- Severe pain, inability to move shoulder
- Shoulder "dead arm" sensation
- Obvious deformity (anterior fullness, posterior depression)
- Apprehension, fear of recurrence

**Physical Examination (After Reduction)**
- **Apprehension test**: Abduction 90° + external rotation → apprehension, sense of imminent dislocation
- **Relocation test**: Posterior force relieves apprehension
- **Anterior drawer test**: Anterior translation
- **Jobe relocation test**: Positive apprehension relieved by posterior force
- Neurovascular examination: Axillary nerve (sensation over deltoid, deltoid function)

**Imaging**
- **Radiographs**: AP, scapular Y, axillary lateral
  - Confirm dislocation (pre-reduction)
  - Hill-Sachs lesion
  - Glenoid rim fracture (bony Bankart)
  - Large glenoid defect (>20%) may require bone block procedure
- **MRI or MR arthrogram**:
  - Bankart lesion
  - Hill-Sachs size and location ("on-track" vs. "off-track")
  - SLAP tear, rotator cuff tear (older patients)
  - Bone loss quantification

**Acute Management**
- **Reduction**: Multiple techniques (Hippocratic, Stimson, external rotation)
  - Procedural sedation typically required
  - Post-reduction films to confirm
- **Immobilization**: Sling 2-4 weeks
  - Younger patients: Consider immobilization in external rotation (controversial)
- **Early rehabilitation**: Pendulum exercises, gradual ROM

**Risk of Recurrence**
- **Age-dependent**: Young (<20 years): 80-90%, Older (>40): 10-20%
- **Activity level**: Contact athletes: Higher risk
- **Bone loss**: Glenoid or Hill-Sachs

**Non-Operative Management**
- **Indications**: First-time dislocation, low-risk (older, low-demand)
- Physical therapy: Rotator cuff and scapular stabilizer strengthening
- Activity modification: Avoid high-risk positions

### Surgical Indications

**Anterior Stabilization**
- First-time dislocation in young, high-demand athlete or contact sport
- Recurrent instability (>1 dislocation)
- Significant bone loss (glenoid >20%, large engaging Hill-Sachs)
- Failed non-operative management

### Surgical Techniques

**Arthroscopic Bankart Repair**
- **Technique**:
  - Diagnostic arthroscopy
  - Mobilize labrum, prepare glenoid rim
  - Place suture anchors at glenoid rim (typically 3-4)
  - Pass sutures through labrum and capsule
  - Tie knots, restore labral bumper
- **Advantages**: Less invasive, faster recovery, less morbidity
- **Disadvantages**: Higher recurrence rates than open (historically), steep learning curve

**Open Bankart Repair**
- **Technique**: Anterior approach, capsular split, repair labrum and capsule to glenoid
- **Advantages**: Lower recurrence rates (5-10%), bone block option
- **Disadvantages**: More invasive, longer recovery, risk of subscapularis injury

**Latarjet Procedure (Bone Block)**
- **Indications**: Glenoid bone loss >20%, failed soft tissue repair, contact athletes, "off-track" Hill-Sachs
- **Technique**:
  - Transfer coracoid process (with attached conjoined tendon) to anterior glenoid
  - Screw fixation
  - Restores bone and creates "sling effect"
- **Advantages**: Lowest recurrence rates (3-5%), addresses bone loss
- **Disadvantages**: More complex, longer recovery, hardware complications, nerve injury risk

**Remplissage**
- **Indication**: Large engaging Hill-Sachs lesion

## Ankle Sprains and Instability

### Anatomy

**Lateral Ligaments** (Most Commonly Injured)
- **Anterior talofibular ligament (ATFL)**: Weakest, prevents anterior translation of talus
- **Calcaneofibular ligament (CFL)**: Prevents inversion
- **Posterior talofibular ligament (PTFL)**: Strongest, rarely injured

**Medial Ligaments (Deltoid Complex)**
- Superficial and deep layers
- Stronger than lateral ligaments, less commonly injured

### Mechanism of Injury

**Lateral Ankle Sprain**
- Inversion injury (90% of ankle sprains)
- Foot plantarflexed and inverted
- Sequential failure: ATFL → CFL → PTFL

**Medial Ankle Sprain**
- Eversion injury
- Often associated with syndesmotic injury or fracture

### Grading

**Lateral Sprains**
- **Grade I**: ATFL stretch, no tear
  - Minimal swelling, able to weight-bear
- **Grade II**: ATFL partial tear ± CFL
  - Moderate swelling, difficulty weight-bearing
- **Grade III**: ATFL + CFL complete tear
  - Severe swelling, unable to weight-bear, instability

### Clinical Presentation

**Symptoms**
- Pain: Lateral ankle, worse with inversion
- Swelling, ecchymosis
- Difficulty walking, bearing weight

**Physical Examination**
- **Inspection**: Swelling, ecchymosis, deformity
- **Palpation**: Tenderness over ATFL, CFL, malleoli, base of 5th metatarsal, navicular
- **Anterior drawer test**: Anterior translation of talus in plantarflexion (ATFL)
- **Talar tilt test**: Inversion stress (CFL)
- **Squeeze test**: Compress tibia and fibula mid-calf (syndesmosis)

### Diagnostic Evaluation

**Ottawa Ankle Rules** (Radiograph Indications)
- Pain in malleolar zone + any of:
  - Bone tenderness at posterior edge or tip of lateral malleolus
  - Bone tenderness at posterior edge or tip of medial malleolus
  - Inability to bear weight immediately and in ED (4 steps)

**Imaging**

- Failed bracing and physical therapy (6 months)

### Surgical Technique

**Anatomic Repair (Broström-Gould)**
- **Technique**:
  - Identify ATFL and CFL remnants
  - Repair directly with sutures or anchors
  - Augment with inferior extensor retinaculum (Gould modification)
- **Outcomes**: 85-95% good to excellent results
- **Indications**: Adequate tissue quality

**Tenodesis Procedures**
- **Indications**: Poor tissue quality, revision, ligamentous laxity
- **Examples**: Chrisman-Snook, Watson-Jones
- **Disadvantage**: Loss of subtalar motion

### Postoperative Management

- Splint: 2 weeks
- Boot: 4 weeks (progressive weight-bearing)
- Physical therapy: ROM and strengthening
- Return to sport: 3-6 months

### Outcomes

- Non-operative success: 85-90% (Grade I-II)
- Surgical success: 85-95% stability restoration
- Return to sport: 90-95%

## Key Points

1. **ACL injuries** are most common in young, active females; surgical reconstruction is indicated for athletes returning to pivoting sports and those with functionally unstable knees.

2. **Graft selection** for ACL reconstruction: BPTB for young, high-demand athletes; hamstring for recreational athletes and those concerned about anterior knee pain; allograft for older patients and revisions.

3. **Return to sport** after ACL reconstruction requires minimum 6-9 months, quadriceps strength >90%, functional testing >90%, and psychological readiness.

4. **Meniscal repair** is preferred over meniscectomy when feasible (young patient, red-red or red-white zone, vertical tear); repair healing enhanced with concurrent ACL reconstruction.

5. **Rotator cuff tears** are age-related and degenerative; repair success depends on tear size, tissue quality (fatty infiltration), and patient factors (age, smoking, compliance).

6. **Arthroscopic rotator cuff repair** offers advantages over open repair (less pain, faster recovery, preserved deltoid) with equivalent outcomes.

7. **Shoulder instability** risk of recurrence after first-time anterior dislocation is age-dependent: 80-90% in young athletes (<20 years), 10-20% in older patients (>40 years).

8. **Latarjet procedure** is indicated for anterior instability with significant glenoid bone loss (>20%), failed soft tissue repair, or high-demand contact athletes; lowest recurrence rates (3-5%).

9. **Ankle sprains** are managed non-operatively with RICE, early mobilization, and rehabilitation; surgery reserved for chronic instability (recurrent sprains) failing 6 months of conservative treatment.

10. **Rehabilitation** is critical for success in all sports injuries; protocols must be individualized and criteria-based for return to sport, not time-based alone.
