# Reconstructive Surgery

## Overview

Reconstructive surgery restores form and function following trauma, oncologic resection, congenital anomalies, burn injuries, and degenerative conditions. The fundamental principles include restoring anatomic structure, preserving or restoring function, achieving acceptable aesthetic outcomes, and minimizing donor site morbidity. Modern reconstructive surgery employs a systematic approach utilizing the reconstructive ladder (simple to complex) or reconstructive elevator (optimal solution regardless of complexity), incorporating skin grafts, local flaps, regional flaps, distant flaps, and free tissue transfer.

## Principles of Reconstruction

### Reconstructive Ladder

**Traditional Hierarchy (Simple to Complex)**
1. **Primary closure**: Direct approximation of wound edges
2. **Secondary intention**: Wound healing by granulation, contraction, epithelialization
3. **Delayed primary closure**: Closure after initial wound management
4. **Skin grafting**: Split-thickness or full-thickness skin grafts
5. **Local flaps**: Adjacent tissue rearrangement
6. **Regional flaps**: Pedicled flaps from nearby regions
7. **Distant flaps**: Pedicled flaps from remote sites
8. **Free tissue transfer**: Microvascular free flaps

**Concept**: Start with simplest option, advance to more complex if needed

### Reconstructive Elevator

**Modern Approach**
- Select **optimal reconstruction** for each defect (not necessarily simplest)
- Consider: Functional requirements, aesthetic goals, patient factors, surgeon expertise
- Free tissue transfer may be best option for complex defects (skip intermediate steps)

### Fundamental Principles

**Wound Assessment**
- **Location**: Anatomic region, proximity to critical structures
- **Size**: Dimensions, depth
- **Tissue components**: Skin, muscle, bone, nerve, vessel involvement
- **Contamination**: Clean, contaminated, infected
- **Timing**: Acute vs. chronic

**Goals of Reconstruction**
1. **Restore function**: Range of motion, sensation, weight-bearing
2. **Provide durable coverage**: Protect vital structures, withstand mechanical stress
3. **Achieve aesthetic outcome**: Color match, texture, contour
4. **Minimize donor site morbidity**: Preserve donor site function

**Debridement**
- **Essential first step**: Remove devitalized tissue, foreign material, contamination
- **Serial debridement**: Multiple procedures for severe injuries, infections
- **Negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT)**: Bridge to definitive reconstruction

## Skin Grafts

### Split-Thickness Skin Grafts (STSG)

**Description**
- **Composition**: Epidermis + partial dermis
- **Thickness**: Thin (0.008-0.012 inches), intermediate (0.012-0.018 inches), thick (0.018-0.030 inches)
- **Donor sites**: Thigh, buttocks, back (large flat surfaces)

**Technique**
1. **Donor site preparation**: Tumescent infiltration, skin lubrication
2. **Harvest**: Dermatome (electric, air-powered), freehand knife (Humby, Weck)
3. **Meshing**: Expand graft (1.5:1, 3:1, 6:1 ratios), improve drainage
4. **Application**: Secure to wound bed (sutures, staples, fibrin glue)
5. **Dressing**: Non-adherent, bolster dressing (immobilize graft)
6. **Donor site care**: Petroleum-impregnated gauze, hydrocolloid, foam dressings

**Graft Take**
- **Imbibition** (0-48 hours): Plasma absorption
- **Inosculation** (48-72 hours): Capillary ingrowth

**Disadvantages**
- **Contraction**: 20-40% graft contraction (thinner grafts contract more)
- **Color mismatch**: Hyperpigmentation or hypopigmentation
- **Fragile**: Thin grafts prone to shear injury
- **No sensation**: Limited sensory return

### Full-Thickness Skin Grafts (FTSG)

**Description**

- **Type IV**: Segmental pedicles (sartorius, tibialis anterior)
- **Type V**: Dominant pedicle + segmental pedicles (latissimus dorsi, pectoralis major)

**Cutaneous Flap Blood Supply**
- **Direct cutaneous artery**: Skin directly vascularized (groin flap, deltopectoral flap)
- **Perforator**: Artery traverses muscle to reach skin (DIEP, ALT, SGAP)
- **Musculocutaneous**: Artery supplies muscle and overlying skin (latissimus, pectoralis)

### Delay Phenomenon

**Concept**: Staged flap elevation improves survival by enhancing blood supply

**Technique**
- Partially elevate flap 1-2 weeks before definitive transfer
- Allows choke vessels to dilate, increases flap vascularity

**Indications**
- Random pattern flaps with marginal blood supply
- Questionable flap viability

### Flap Monitoring

**Clinical Monitoring**
- **Color**: Pink (normal), pale (arterial insufficiency), dusky/purple (venous congestion)
- **Capillary refill**: <2 seconds (normal), slow (arterial), rapid (venous)
- **Temperature**: Warm (normal), cool (arterial)
- **Turgor**: Soft (normal), firm/tense (venous)
- **Bleeding**: Pinprick test (bright red = arterial, dark = venous, none = failure)

**Adjuncts**
- **Doppler ultrasound**: Assess arterial signal
- **Implantable Doppler**: Continuous monitoring (Cook-Swartz Doppler)
- **Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS)**: Tissue oxygenation

**Frequency**
- **First 48-72 hours**: Hourly (highest risk period)
- **Days 3-7**: Every 2-4 hours
- **After 1 week**: Daily

### Flap Salvage

**Arterial Insufficiency**
- **Presentation**: Pale, cool, slow capillary refill, no Doppler signal
- **Causes**: Arterial thrombosis, kinking, compression, vasospasm
- **Management**:
  - **Return to OR emergently** (<6 hours)
  - Re-explore anastomosis, revise if thrombosed
  - Heparin, antiplatelet agents
  - Thrombolytics (rarely)

**Venous Congestion**
- **Presentation**: Dusky, swollen, rapid capillary refill, dark blood on pinprick
- **Causes**: Venous thrombosis, kinking, compression
- **Management**:
  - **Return to OR emergently**
  - Re-explore venous anastomosis
  - Medicinal leeches (Hirudo medicinalis): Reduce congestion, allow neovascularization (2-7 days)
  - Heparin (leech saliva has anticoagulant effect, monitor for bleeding)

**Salvage Rates**
- **Early intervention** (<6 hours): 50-80% salvage
- **Delayed intervention** (>12 hours): <20% salvage

## Postoperative Management

### General Care

**Flap Monitoring**
- Hourly for first 48-72 hours
- Clinical assessment ± Doppler

**Positioning**
- Avoid pressure on pedicle, flap
- Elevate extremity flaps (reduce edema)

**Anticoagulation**
- **Aspirin**: Standard for free flaps (81-325 mg daily)
- **Heparin**: Controversial (some centers use low-dose heparin)
- **No strong evidence** for routine anticoagulation beyond aspirin

**Activity Restrictions**
- Bed rest × 24-48 hours (free flaps)
- Gradual mobilization

**Nutrition**
- Optimize wound healing (protein, vitamins)

### Complications

**Hematoma**
- Early postoperative bleeding
- Management: Evacuation (bedside or OR), identify source

**Seroma**
- Fluid collection (common with large flaps)
- Management: Drainage, compression

**Infection**
- Risk factors: Contaminated wounds, diabetes, immunosuppression
- Management: Antibiotics, debridement if abscess

**Flap Loss**
- **Partial**: Necrosis of distal flap (debride, skin graft)
- **Total**: Repeat reconstruction

**Donor Site Complications**
- Wound dehiscence, hernia (TRAM/DIEP), seroma, chronic pain

## Key Points

1. **Reconstructive ladder** provides a systematic approach from simple (primary closure) to complex (free tissue transfer); **reconstructive elevator** selects the optimal solution regardless of complexity.

2. **Split-thickness skin grafts (STSG)** contract 20-40% and are suitable for large surface areas; **full-thickness skin grafts (FTSG)** have less contraction and better aesthetics but limited donor sites.

3. **Local flaps** (advancement, rotation, transposition) provide similar tissue characteristics and single-stage reconstruction; **Z-plasty** with 60-degree angles lengthens scars by 75%.

4. **Pedicled regional flaps** include pectoralis major (head/neck), latissimus dorsi (breast/extremity), and gastrocnemius (knee); offer robust blood supply but limited arc of rotation.

5. **Lower extremity trauma reconstruction** follows anatomic zones: gastrocnemius for Zone III (knee), soleus for Zone II (mid-leg), and free flaps for Zone I (ankle/foot) and complex defects.

6. **Burn contracture release** techniques include Z-plasty (linear contractures), skin grafts (moderate contractures), and tissue expansion (large facial contractures); splinting and physical therapy prevent recurrence.

7. **DIEP flap** (deep inferior epigastric perforator) is the gold standard for autologous breast reconstruction; spares rectus muscle, reducing abdominal wall morbidity vs. TRAM flap.

8. **Fibula free flap** is the workhorse for mandibular reconstruction; provides 25-30 cm of bone with reliable blood supply and can be combined with soft tissue paddle.

9. **Flap monitoring** is critical in first 48-72 hours; **venous congestion** (dusky, rapid capillary refill) and **arterial insufficiency** (pale, slow capillary refill) require emergent exploration within 6 hours.

10. **Medicinal leeches** are used for venous congestion salvage; reduce congestion, allow neovascularization over 2-7 days; require antibiotic prophylaxis (Aeromonas hydrophila risk).
