# Plastic Surgery

## Overview
Plastic surgery encompasses both reconstructive and aesthetic surgical procedures to restore form and function. The specialty focuses on the repair, reconstruction, or replacement of physical defects affecting the musculoskeletal system, skin, and underlying tissues. Modern plastic surgery utilizes advanced microsurgical techniques, tissue engineering, and innovative approaches to address congenital anomalies, traumatic injuries, oncologic defects, burn injuries, and aesthetic concerns. Success requires expertise in wound healing, flap design, microsurgery, and patient-centered outcomes.
