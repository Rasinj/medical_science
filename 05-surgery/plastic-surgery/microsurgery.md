# Microsurgery

## Overview

Microsurgery is the precise surgical technique utilizing an operating microscope and specialized instruments to repair or reconstruct structures <3 mm in diameter, including blood vessels, nerves, and lymphatic channels. The field enables free tissue transfer (free flaps), replantation, nerve repair and reconstruction, and lymphatic surgery. Since its inception in the 1960s with successful digital replantation and free tissue transfer, microsurgery has revolutionized reconstructive surgery, providing options for complex defects that were previously untreatable. Success requires meticulous technique, specialized training, patience, and optimal perioperative management.

## Principles of Microsurgery

### Instrumentation

**Operating Microscope**
- Magnification: 6-40× (typical: 10-25×)
- Illumination: Coaxial fiberoptic light
- Binocular vision (stereopsis)
- Foot pedals: Focus, zoom, XY positioning

**Microsurgical Instruments**
- **Forceps**: Jeweler's forceps, 0.12 mm tips, smooth or tying platform
- **Needle holders**: Straight or curved, locking or non-locking
- **Scissors**: Straight or curved, sharp or blunt
- **Clamps**: Vascular approximators (single, double), temporary occlusion clamps
- **Dilators**: Vessel dilators (0.3-1.5 mm)
- **Background materials**: Blue or green surgical towels (contrast for vessels)

**Sutures**
- **Size**: 8-0 to 12-0 nylon (vessels), 9-0 to 11-0 (nerves)
- **Needles**: Tapered, 50-100 micron diameter, 3-6 mm curved

**Irrigation**
- Heparinized saline (10-100 units/mL)
- Papaverine (topical vasodilator, 30-60 mg in 60 mL saline)
- Lidocaine (2%, topical vasodilator)

### Microvascular Anastomosis Technique

**Vessel Preparation**
1. **Atraumatic handling**: Avoid crushing vessel wall (use adventitia only with forceps)
2. **Vessel transection**: Sharp perpendicular cut (scalpel or microscissors)
3. **Adventitia stripping**: Remove 1-2 mm adventitia from vessel ends (prevents intimal contact with adventitia → thrombosis)
4. **Irrigation**: Flush lumen with heparinized saline
5. **Dilation**: Gently dilate with dilators or forceps (relieve spasm, assess lumen)
6. **Assess vessel ends**: Healthy intima (white, smooth), no dissection or crush injury

**Anastomosis Technique**

**End-to-End Anastomosis** (Most Common)
1. **Approximate vessel ends**: Align size-matched vessels, no tension
2. **Place approximator clamps**: Double clamps or background suture
3. **First suture** (stay suture): Place at "12 o'clock" position, pass inside-out on each side, tie
4. **Second stay suture**: Place at "6 o'clock" (180° from first), creates two halves
5. **Complete anterior wall**: Place interrupted sutures between stay sutures (typically 2-3 sutures per quadrant)
6. **Flip vessel**: Rotate clamps, expose posterior wall
7. **Complete posterior wall**: Place interrupted sutures
8. **Suture spacing**: Equal distance apart (1.5-2× vessel wall thickness, typically 1-2 mm for 2-3 mm vessels)
9. **Remove clamps**: Release distal clamp (retrograde fill), then proximal clamp
10. **Assess patency**: Observe flow (brisk pulsatile arterial flow, dark blue venous flow), absence of thrombus
11. **Hemostasis**: Gentle pressure with moist surgical sponge, topical thrombin, avoid repeated clamping

**End-to-Side Anastomosis**
- Donor vessel larger than recipient
- Technique: Arteriotomy or venotomy on side of donor vessel, anastomose recipient vessel to opening
- Indications: Size mismatch, vessel length discrepancy

**Suture Technique**
- **Needle angle**: 90° to vessel wall
- **Bite depth**: Full thickness (intima to adventitia), 0.5-1 mm from edge
- **Knot**: Surgeon's knot (2-1-1) or square knot, 3-4 throws, outside vessel lumen
- **Tension**: Tie snugly (not tight), approximates vessel edges without strangulation

**Coupler Devices**
- Mechanical anastomosis (staples, pins)
- **Advantages**: Faster, consistent
- **Disadvantages**: Size-limited, not for arteries <1 mm, cost
- **Indications**: Venous anastomosis (some surgeons), specific free flaps

**Alternatives to Microsurgery**
- **Vein grafts**: Interpositional vein graft for gap
- **Arteriovenous loop**: Create loop between artery and vein, anastomose flap to loop

### Factors Affecting Success

**Technical Factors**
- Atraumatic technique
- Tension-free anastomosis
- No kinking, twisting of vessels
- Adequate vessel wall apposition (no gaps, no excess intima prolapse)
- Adequate vessel size match (optimal 1:1, acceptable 2:1)

**Systemic Factors**
- Hemodynamic stability (avoid hypotension, hypothermia)
- Avoid vasopressors (when possible)
- Adequate intravascular volume
- Normothermia (hypothermia causes vasoconstriction)

**Patient Factors**
- Smoking cessation (minimum 4 weeks before surgery)
- Avoid vasoconstrictive medications, caffeine
- Diabetes control
- No peripheral vascular disease

**Intraoperative Adjuncts**
- **Systemic heparinization**: Controversial (some surgeons use 3000-5000 units IV)
- **Topical vasodilators**: Papaverine, lidocaine
- **Antispasmodic agents**: Verapamil (Ca-channel blocker)

## Free Tissue Transfer

### Principles

- **Hand/arm** (muscle): 6-8 hours cold, 3-4 hours warm
- **Cooling**: 4°C (ice, avoid direct contact with tissue, wrap in saline-soaked gauze)

### Surgical Technique (Digital Replantation)

**Sequence of Repair**

**1. Bone Fixation** (First Step)
- Shorten bone 0.5-1 cm (reduce tension on soft tissues, vessels)
- **Methods**: K-wires (most common), intraosseous wiring, plate/screws
- Restore length, rotation, alignment

**2. Tendon Repair**
- **Extensor tendons**: Repair (easier access, dorsal approach)
- **Flexor tendons**: Repair (may defer if unstable, perform secondarily)

**3. Arterial Anastomosis** (Critical Step)
- Repair 1-2 digital arteries (if possible)
- **Vein graft**: Use if vessel gap (volar forearm vein, dorsal hand vein)

**4. Nerve Repair**
- Repair digital nerves (restore sensation)
- Primary repair or nerve graft

**5. Venous Anastomosis**
- Repair 2-3 dorsal veins (veins more critical than arteries)
- **Venous insufficiency** is more common than arterial insufficiency
- If no suitable veins: **Medicinal leeches** (transitional, allow neovascularization)

**6. Skin Closure**
- Loose closure, avoid tension
- Leave wounds open if needed (delayed closure, skin graft)

**Postoperative Management**
- **Anticoagulation**: Aspirin (standard), heparin (some surgeons)
- **Smoking cessation**: Absolute
- **Warmth**: Keep patient and limb warm (prevent vasoconstriction)
- **Elevation**: Minimize edema
- **Monitor perfusion**: Hourly (color, capillary refill, temperature)
- **Leech therapy**: If venous congestion (Hirudo medicinalis)
  - Apply leeches to replanted part (30-60 minutes feeding)
  - Antibiotic prophylaxis: Fluoroquinolone (Aeromonas hydrophila risk)
  - Replace leeches q4-8 hours × 3-7 days
  - Monitor hemoglobin (leeches cause bleeding 12-24 hours post-feeding)

### Outcomes

**Success Rate**
- **Digital replantation**: 80-90% survival
- **Major limb replantation**: 70-85% survival

**Functional Outcomes**
- **Sensory recovery**: Better in children, distal amputations
- **Motor recovery**: Variable, depends on level, nerve repair quality
- **Cold intolerance**: Common (50-80%), may improve over years
- **Stiffness**: Extensive therapy required

**Factors Affecting Outcome**
- **Mechanism**: Sharp better than crush/avulsion
- **Ischemia time**: Shorter better
- **Level**: Distal better than proximal
- **Patient age**: Children better recovery
- **Smoking**: Worse outcome

## Nerve Repair and Grafting

### Nerve Injury Classification

**Seddon**
- **Neurapraxia**: Conduction block, intact axon (full recovery)
- **Axonotmesis**: Axonal disruption, intact endoneurium (regeneration 1 mm/day)
- **Neurotmesis**: Complete transection (requires repair)

**Sunderland**
- Grade I-V (I = neurapraxia, V = neurotmesis)

### Nerve Repair Techniques

**Primary Repair** (Direct Coaptation)
- **Indications**: Clean sharp laceration, gap <5 mm, tension-free
- **Technique**:
  - Epineural repair (most common): 9-0 or 10-0 nylon, 4-6 sutures around circumference
  - Group fascicular repair: Match fascicular groups, intraneural dissection
- **Alignment**: Match nerve diameter, fascicular pattern, epineural vessels

**Nerve Grafting**
- **Indications**: Gap >5 mm, excessive tension with primary repair
- **Autograft** (gold standard): Sural nerve, medial/lateral antebrachial cutaneous nerve
- **Technique**: Cable grafts (multiple strands), tension-free coaptation
- **Disadvantages**: Two coaptation sites, donor site morbidity (sensory loss)

**Nerve Conduits**
- **Synthetic**: Polyglycolic acid (PGA), polycaprolactone
- **Biologic**: Collagen, processed nerve allograft (Avance)
- **Indications**: Short gaps (<3 cm), digital nerves
- **Outcomes**: Inferior to autograft for large gaps

**Nerve Transfer (Neurotization)**
- **Concept**: Sacrifice expendable donor nerve to reinnervate critical target
- **Indications**: Proximal nerve injury, brachial plexus injury, long regeneration distance
- **Examples**:
  - **Oberlin transfer**: Ulnar nerve fascicle to musculocutaneous nerve (elbow flexion)
  - **Mackinnon distal nerve transfer**: Median to ulnar or ulnar to median (restore hand function)

### Nerve Regeneration

**Rate**: 1 mm/day (or 1 inch/month)

**Tinel Sign**: Percussion over regenerating nerve → tingling (advances distally)

**Factors Affecting Regeneration**
- **Patient age**: Younger better
- **Injury mechanism**: Sharp better than crush/avulsion
- **Time to repair**: Earlier better
- **Gap**: Shorter better

**Outcomes**
- **Sensory recovery**: Better than motor (S3-S4 achievable)
- **Motor recovery**: Variable (M3-M4 typical for major nerves)
- **Timing**: Proximal injuries take years (regeneration 1 mm/day from repair site to target)

## Lymphatic Reconstruction

### Lymphedema Pathophysiology

**Definition**: Abnormal accumulation of protein-rich fluid due to impaired lymphatic drainage

**Classification**
- **Primary**: Congenital (Milroy disease, Meige disease)
- **Secondary**: Acquired (lymph node dissection, radiation, infection, trauma, malignancy)

**Staging** (International Society of Lymphology)
- **Stage 0**: Latent, no edema
- **Stage I**: Pitting edema, reduces with elevation
- **Stage II**: Non-pitting edema, fibrosis
- **Stage III**: Lymphostatic elephantiasis (severe fibrosis, skin changes)

### Treatment

**Non-Operative**
- **Complete decongestive therapy (CDT)**: Compression, manual lymphatic drainage, exercise, skin care
- **Pneumatic compression devices**
- **Lifelong management** (no cure)

**Operative** (Physiologic vs. Excisional)

**Physiologic Procedures** (Microsurgical)

**Lymphovenous Anastomosis (LVA)**
- **Technique**: Anastomose lymphatic channels (0.5-1 mm) to subdermal venules (supermicrosurgery, 12-0 or finer sutures)
- **Indications**: Early lymphedema (Stage I-II), patent lymphatics on imaging (ICG lymphography)
- **Advantages**: Minimally invasive, outpatient, low morbidity
- **Outcomes**: 60-80% improvement (reduced limb volume, reduced compression needs)

**Vascularized Lymph Node Transfer (VLNT)**
- **Technique**: Transfer lymph node-containing flap to affected limb
- **Donor sites**: Groin (superficial inguinal nodes), supraclavicular, submental, omental
- **Recipients**: Axilla (upper extremity lymphedema), groin (lower extremity)
- **Indications**: Moderate-severe lymphedema (Stage II-III)
- **Outcomes**: 50-70% improvement, may allow discontinuation of compression

**Lymphatic Vessel Grafting**
- Transfer of lymphatic vessels from donor site to affected limb
- Investigational, limited use

**Excisional Procedures**

**Charles Procedure**
- **Technique**: Excise all skin and subcutaneous tissue, apply skin graft
- **Indications**: Stage III elephantiasis (salvage)
- **Disadvantages**: Poor aesthetic outcome, recurrence

**Liposuction**
- **Technique**: Aggressive circumferential liposuction (remove fibroadipose tissue)
- **Indications**: Stage II-III (non-pitting, fibrotic)
- **Adjunct**: Lifelong compression garment
- **Outcomes**: 30-50% volume reduction

### Lymphatic Imaging

**Indocyanine Green (ICG) Lymphography**
- Intradermal ICG injection, near-infrared camera visualizes lymphatic flow
- Distinguish patent vs. occluded lymphatics
- Guide surgical planning (LVA vs. VLNT)

**MR Lymphangiography**
- Visualize lymphatic anatomy, nodes

## Key Points

1. **Microvascular anastomosis** requires atraumatic technique, tension-free approximation, adventitia removal, and equal suture spacing (1.5-2× vessel wall thickness); typical arterial anastomosis uses 8-10 interrupted sutures (9-0 or 10-0 nylon).

2. **Free flap success rate** is 95-99% in experienced hands; flap monitoring is critical in first 48-72 hours with hourly clinical assessment (color, capillary refill, temperature, turgor, pinprick).

3. **Venous congestion** is more common than arterial insufficiency in free flaps; presents as dusky color, rapid capillary refill with dark blood, and firm turgor; treated with re-exploration and/or medicinal leeches.

4. **Anterolateral thigh (ALT) flap** is the workhorse free flap for large defects; based on descending branch lateral circumflex femoral artery with perforators; provides up to 25×35 cm tissue with minimal donor morbidity.

5. **Fibula free flap** provides 25-30 cm of vascularized bone (longest available) based on peroneal artery; gold standard for mandibular reconstruction and long bone defects.

6. **Digital replantation** survival rate is 80-90%; absolute indications include thumb, multiple digits, any part in children, and sharp wrist/forearm amputations; ischemia tolerance is 12-24 hours cold for digits.

7. **Bone fixation is performed first** in replantation (establishes skeletal stability); followed by extensor tendons, arteries, nerves, and veins; venous repair is critical (more important than arterial) with 2-3 dorsal veins anastomosed.

8. **Medicinal leeches** (Hirudo medicinalis) treat venous congestion in replantation and free flaps; feed for 30-60 minutes, replaced q4-8 hours × 3-7 days; antibiotic prophylaxis required for Aeromonas hydrophila risk.

9. **Nerve regeneration** occurs at 1 mm/day; Tinel sign (tingling with percussion) advances distally as nerve regenerates; nerve grafting indicated if gap >5 mm with sural nerve as gold standard donor.

10. **Lymphovenous anastomosis (LVA)** is minimally invasive treatment for early lymphedema (Stage I-II); supermicrosurgery anastomosing 0.5-1 mm lymphatic channels to venules using 12-0 sutures; 60-80% improvement in limb volume.
