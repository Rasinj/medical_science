# Adolescent Medicine

## Overview

Adolescent medicine focuses on the unique healthcare needs of individuals during the transitional period between childhood and adulthood, typically spanning ages 10-21 years. This developmental stage is characterized by rapid physical growth, sexual maturation, cognitive development, identity formation, and increasing independence. Adolescents face unique health challenges including risk-taking behaviors, mental health issues, reproductive health concerns, and chronic disease management during a critical developmental period.

**Key Concept**: Adolescent healthcare requires a confidential, non-judgmental approach that respects developing autonomy while maintaining appropriate parental involvement and addressing the biopsychosocial needs of this unique developmental stage.

### Epidemiology
- **Population**: Approximately 42 million adolescents in the United States (ages 10-19)
- **Leading causes of death**: Unintentional injuries, suicide, homicide
- **Morbidity**: Mental health disorders, sexually transmitted infections, obesity, substance use
- **Healthcare utilization**: Often underutilize preventive care services

### Developmental Stages of Adolescence

#### Early Adolescence (10-13 years)
- **Physical**: Puberty begins, rapid growth
- **Cognitive**: Concrete thinking, focus on present
- **Social**: Peer group importance increasing, same-sex friendships
- **Identity**: Body image concerns, emotional volatility
- **Family**: Beginning to question parental authority

#### Middle Adolescence (14-17 years)
- **Physical**: Puberty progresses/completes
- **Cognitive**: Developing abstract thinking, risk perception still immature
- **Social**: Romantic relationships, peer conformity peaks
- **Identity**: Experimentation with different identities/roles
- **Family**: Increasing independence, potential for conflict

#### Late Adolescence (18-21 years)
- **Physical**: Adult body achieved
- **Cognitive**: Abstract thinking, future-oriented
- **Social**: Individual relationships more important than peer group
- **Identity**: More stable sense of self
- **Family**: Reestablishment of adult-adult relationship

## Puberty and Physical Development

### Normal Puberty

#### Tanner Stages

##### Female Breast Development
- **Stage 1**: Prepubertal, no breast tissue
- **Stage 2**: Breast buds, areola enlarges (thelarche)
- **Stage 3**: Breast and areola enlarge, no contour separation

- **Stage 2**: Sparse, lightly pigmented, straight hair
- **Stage 3**: Darker, coarser, curlier, increased amount
- **Stage 4**: Adult type hair, not extending to medial thigh
- **Stage 5**: Adult distribution, extending to medial thigh

##### Male Genital Development
- **Stage 1**: Prepubertal
- **Stage 2**: Testicular enlargement (>2.5 cm), scrotum thins and reddens
- **Stage 3**: Penis lengthens, testes and scrotum enlarge

##### Stress Fractures
- **Common sites**: Tibia, metatarsals, fibula
- **Risk factors**: Female athlete triad, rapid training increase, inadequate nutrition
- **Symptoms**: Localized pain, worse with activity
- **Diagnosis**: X-ray (may be negative initially), MRI if high suspicion
- **Management**: Rest from impact activities 6-8 weeks, gradual return

### Female Athlete Triad

#### Components
1. **Low energy availability**: With or without disordered eating
2. **Menstrual dysfunction**: Amenorrhea, oligomenorrhea
3. **Low bone mineral density**: Osteopenia, osteoporosis

#### Risk Factors
- **Sports emphasizing leanness**: Distance running, gymnastics, dance, figure skating
- **Aesthetic sports**: Diving, cheerleading
- **Weight-class sports**: Wrestling, rowing

#### Screening
- **All female athletes**: Annual screening questions
- **Menstrual history**: Age at menarche, regularity, recent patterns
- **Nutrition**: Dietary restriction, weight concerns
- **Stress fractures**: History of multiple or unusual sites

#### Management
- **Multidisciplinary**: Physician, dietitian, mental health professional
- **Nutrition**: Increase energy intake, treat eating disorder
- **Resume menses**: Goal within 6 months
- **Bone health**: Calcium, vitamin D, weight-bearing activity
- **Sport participation**: May need restriction if high risk (stress fracture, very low BMD)

## Transition to Adult Care

### Importance
- **Chronic conditions**: Need to continue care into adulthood
- **Healthcare interruption**: Risk when aging out of pediatric care
- **Adult health literacy**: Understanding health needs, insurance, making appointments

### Transition Process

#### Early Adolescence
- **Introduce concept**: Eventual transfer to adult care
- **Self-management skills**: Taking medications independently, understanding conditions

#### Middle Adolescence
- **Increase autonomy**: Adolescent answers questions, manages appointments
- **Health literacy**: Teach about insurance, prescriptions, medical records
- **Portable medical summary**: Create summary of conditions, medications

#### Late Adolescence
- **Transfer planning**: Identify adult providers
- **Final pediatric visit**: Ensure all preventive care up to date
- **Transfer of information**: Medical summary to adult provider
- **Follow-up**: Confirm adolescent established care with adult provider

## Key Points

- Adolescent development proceeds through early, middle, and late stages with distinct characteristics
- Confidential, non-judgmental care with HEADSS assessment is essential for adolescent health maintenance
- Normal puberty onset: females 8-13 years (breasts first), males 9-14 years (testes first)
- Depression screening recommended annually starting age 12; SSRIs with therapy for moderate-severe
- LARC methods (IUD, implant) are most effective contraception for adolescents
- Annual chlamydia screening recommended for all sexually active females
- CRAFFT is validated screening tool for adolescent substance use
- Concussion management requires graduated return to learn before return to play
- Female athlete triad includes low energy availability, menstrual dysfunction, low bone density
- Transition planning for chronic conditions should begin in early adolescence
- HPV vaccination recommended for all adolescents starting age 11-12
- Suicide is second leading cause of death; all depressed adolescents need safety assessment
