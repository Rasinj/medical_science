# Congenital Disorders

## Overview

Congenital disorders are structural or functional abnormalities present at birth, though they may not be diagnosed until later in life. These conditions can result from genetic factors, environmental exposures, multifactorial inheritance, or unknown causes. Congenital disorders affect approximately 3-5% of all births and represent a leading cause of infant mortality and childhood morbidity worldwide. Early recognition, accurate diagnosis, and appropriate management are essential for optimizing outcomes.

**Key Concept**: Congenital disorders encompass a wide spectrum from isolated minor anomalies to complex multi-system syndromes, requiring interdisciplinary care and family support.

### Classification
- **Structural malformations**: Anatomic defects (heart defects, cleft lip)
- **Functional abnormalities**: Metabolic, endocrine, immunologic disorders
- **Chromosomal disorders**: Aneuploidies, deletions, duplications
- **Single gene disorders**: Mendelian inheritance patterns
- **Multifactorial**: Genetic and environmental interaction

### Epidemiology
- **Prevalence**: 3-5% of all live births
- **Mortality**: Leading cause of infant death (20% of infant deaths)
- **Burden**: Lifelong impact on affected individuals and families
- **Prevention**: Folic acid supplementation, genetic counseling, prenatal screening

### Etiology

#### Genetic Factors (25-30%)
- **Chromosomal abnormalities**: 6% of congenital disorders
- **Single gene defects**: 7.5% of congenital disorders
- **Multifactorial inheritance**: 20% of congenital disorders

#### Environmental Factors (10%)
- **Maternal infections**: TORCH infections
- **Medications**: Teratogens (valproate, isotretinoin, thalidomide)
- **Maternal conditions**: Diabetes, phenylketonuria, hypothyroidism
- **Substances**: Alcohol, tobacco, illicit drugs
- **Radiation**: Ionizing radiation exposure

#### Unknown (60-65%)
- **Majority**: Cause cannot be identified
- **Likely multifactorial**: Complex gene-environment interactions

## Congenital Heart Disease

### Overview

Congenital heart disease (CHD) is the most common type of birth defect, affecting approximately 8-10 per 1,000 live births. CHD encompasses a wide range of structural abnormalities of the heart and great vessels, from simple defects that may resolve spontaneously to complex lesions requiring surgical intervention in the neonatal period.

### Classification

#### Acyanotic (Left-to-Right Shunts)
- **Atrial septal defect (ASD)**
- **Ventricular septal defect (VSD)**
- **Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA)**
- **Atrioventricular septal defect (AVSD)**

#### Acyanotic (Obstructive Lesions)
- **Aortic stenosis**
- **Pulmonary stenosis**
- **Coarctation of the aorta**

#### Cyanotic
- **Tetralogy of Fallot**
- **Transposition of the great arteries (TGA)**

### Ventricular Septal Defect (VSD)

#### Description
- **Most common CHD**: 25-30% of all CHD
- **Location**: Defect in ventricular septum
- **Types**: Membranous (75%), muscular (25%)
- **Hemodynamics**: Left-to-right shunt

#### Clinical Presentation

- **Moderate VSD**: Mild symptoms, FTT, recurrent respiratory infections
- **Large VSD**: Heart failure, poor feeding, tachypnea, hepatomegaly
- **Physical exam**: Holosystolic murmur at left lower sternal border

#### Natural History
- **Spontaneous closure**: 30-50% close by age 2, especially muscular VSDs
- **Small VSDs**: May close or remain stable
- **Large VSDs**: Risk of pulmonary hypertension, Eisenmenger syndrome

#### Diagnosis
- **Echocardiography**: Definitive diagnosis, size and location
- **Chest x-ray**: Cardiomegaly, increased pulmonary markings (large defects)
- **ECG**: LVH, RVH (large defects)
- **Cardiac catheterization**: Rarely needed

#### Management
- **Small VSD**: Observation, SBE prophylaxis (controversial)
