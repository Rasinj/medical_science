# Pediatrics

## Overview

Pediatrics is the medical specialty focused on the health and medical care of infants, children, and adolescents from birth through age 18-21. Pediatric medicine emphasizes the unique physiological, developmental, psychological, and social aspects of growing children, recognizing that children are not simply "small adults" but have distinct anatomical, physiological, and developmental characteristics that require specialized knowledge and approaches to care.

## Core Principles of Pediatric Medicine

### Developmental Approach
- **Age-specific assessment**: Physical examination and history-taking adapted to developmental stage
- **Growth monitoring**: Continuous tracking of physical, cognitive, and social-emotional development
- **Anticipatory guidance**: Preventive counseling about upcoming developmental milestones
- **Developmental surveillance**: Ongoing monitoring for developmental delays or disorders

### Family-Centered Care
- **Parental involvement**: Parents as partners in healthcare decisions
- **Cultural sensitivity**: Respect for diverse family structures and cultural practices
- **Communication**: Age-appropriate communication with child and family education
- **Psychosocial context**: Understanding family dynamics, social determinants of health

### Prevention Focus
- **Well-child care**: Regular health supervision visits
