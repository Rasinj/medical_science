# Movement Disorders

## Overview

Movement disorders are neurological conditions characterized by abnormal voluntary or involuntary movements. They result from dysfunction in the basal ganglia, cerebellum, or their connections with the motor cortex. These disorders can manifest as either excessive movement (hyperkinetic) or reduced movement (hypokinetic), significantly impacting quality of life and functional independence.

### Classification
- **Hypokinetic disorders**: Reduced movement (Parkinson's disease, parkinsonism)
- **Hyperkinetic disorders**: Excessive movement (dystonia, chorea, tremor, tics)
- **Mixed disorders**: Combination of features
- **Ataxic disorders**: Cerebellar dysfunction causing incoordination

## Pathophysiology

### Basal Ganglia Circuitry

#### Normal Function
- **Direct pathway**: Striatum → internal globus pallidus → thalamus → motor cortex
- **Indirect pathway**: Striatum → external globus pallidus → subthalamic nucleus → internal globus pallidus
- **Balance**: Normal movement requires balanced direct and indirect pathway activity
- **Dopamine role**: Modulates striatal activity, facilitates movement initiation

#### Pathological Changes
- **Hypokinetic**: Increased indirect pathway activity, reduced movement
- **Hyperkinetic**: Increased direct pathway activity, excessive movement
- **Neurotransmitter imbalance**: Dopamine, acetylcholine, GABA dysfunction
- **Structural lesions**: Specific anatomical damage patterns

### Cerebellar Pathophysiology
- **Motor coordination**: Fine-tuning of movement execution
- **Learning**: Motor skill acquisition and adaptation
- **Balance**: Postural control and equilibrium
- **Dysfunction**: Ataxia, dysmetria, intention tremor

## Parkinson's Disease

### Overview
- **Prevalence**: 0.1-0.3% of population, increases with age
- **Demographics**: More common in men, onset typically 55-65 years
- **Pathology**: Progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in substantia nigra
- **Hallmark**: Lewy bodies containing α-synuclein protein

### Pathophysiology

#### Neurodegeneration
- **Primary site**: Substantia nigra pars compacta
- **Protein aggregation**: α-synuclein misfolding and accumulation
- **Mitochondrial dysfunction**: Impaired cellular energy production
- **Oxidative stress**: Free radical damage
- **Inflammation**: Microglial activation and neuroinflammation

#### Motor Circuit Dysfunction
- **Dopamine depletion**: Reduced striatal dopamine levels
- **Circuit imbalance**: Increased indirect pathway activity
- **Oscillations**: Abnormal synchronization in basal ganglia networks
- **Compensatory mechanisms**: Initially mask symptoms until 60-80% neuron loss
