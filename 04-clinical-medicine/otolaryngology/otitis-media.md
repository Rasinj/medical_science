# Otitis Media

## Overview

Otitis media (OM) is inflammation of the middle ear, representing one of the most common diagnoses in pediatric and family practice. It affects approximately 80% of children by age 3, with billions of dollars spent annually on diagnosis and treatment. Otitis media encompasses a spectrum of conditions including acute otitis media (AOM), otitis media with effusion (OME), and chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM). Understanding the pathophysiology, clinical presentations, evidence-based management, and potential complications is essential for appropriate diagnosis and treatment while minimizing antibiotic overuse.

### Epidemiology
- **Pediatric incidence**: Peak at 6-18 months, 80% experience at least one episode by age 3
- **Healthcare burden**: Leading reason for pediatric office visits and antibiotic prescriptions
- **Economic impact**: $5-6 billion annually in the US
- **Seasonal variation**: Higher in fall and winter
- **Declining incidence**: Since pneumococcal vaccination introduction
- **Resolution**: Most OME resolves spontaneously within 3 months

### Classification
- **Acute otitis media (AOM)**: Acute infection with middle ear effusion
- **Otitis media with effusion (OME)**: Fluid without signs of acute infection
- **Recurrent AOM**: ≥3 episodes in 6 months or ≥4 in 12 months
- **Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM)**: Persistent drainage through perforation
- **Chronic OME**: Effusion persisting >3 months

## Middle Ear Anatomy and Physiology

### Middle Ear Structure

#### Boundaries
- **Lateral**: Tympanic membrane
- **Medial**: Promontory of cochlea, oval window, round window
- **Anterior**: Eustachian tube opening
- **Posterior**: Mastoid air cells via aditus ad antrum
- **Superior**: Tegmen tympani (thin bone separating from middle cranial fossa)
- **Inferior**: Jugular bulb

#### Contents
- **Ossicles**: Malleus, incus, stapes
- **Muscles**: Tensor tympani, stapedius
- **Nerves**: Chorda tympani (taste, parasympathetic), tympanic plexus
- **Mucosa**: Respiratory epithelium with ciliated cells

#### Mastoid Air Cells
- **Pneumatization**: Develops during childhood
- **Connected**: To middle ear via aditus ad antrum
- **Function**: Pressure buffer, gas reservoir
- **Variability**: Degree of pneumatization varies

### Eustachian Tube Function

#### Normal Function
- **Primary functions**:
  - Pressure equalization (between middle ear and nasopharynx)
  - Drainage of middle ear secretions
  - Protection from nasopharyngeal secretions
- **Opening mechanism**: Tensor veli palatini muscle contraction during swallowing, yawning
- **Closed at rest**: Prevents reflux
- **Opening**: Transient with swallowing (⅓ to ½ second)

#### Pediatric Differences
- **More horizontal**: 10° vs 45° in adults
- **Shorter**: 17-18 mm vs 31-38 mm in adults
- **Wider**: More patent
- **Less rigid**: Cartilaginous portion less developed
- **Adenoid proximity**: Hypertrophic adenoids can obstruct

#### Dysfunction Consequences
- **Negative middle ear pressure**: Impaired equalization
- **Retraction**: Tympanic membrane retracts
- **Effusion**: Transudation of fluid into middle ear
- **Impaired drainage**: Secretions accumulate
- **Predisposition to infection**: Static fluid ideal for bacterial growth

## Acute Otitis Media (AOM)

### Pathophysiology

#### Bacterial Colonization
- **Nasopharyngeal colonization**: Bacteria ascend via Eustachian tube
- **Common pathogens**:
  - Streptococcus pneumoniae: 30-50% (decreased with PCV vaccination)
  - Haemophilus influenzae (non-typeable): 20-30%
  - Moraxella catarrhalis: 10-15%
  - Streptococcus pyogenes: 5-10%
  - Others: Staphylococcus aureus (including MRSA), viruses

#### Viral Upper Respiratory Infection
- **Preceding viral infection**: 60-90% of AOM cases
- **Mechanisms**:
  - Eustachian tube edema and obstruction
  - Increased nasopharyngeal bacterial colonization
  - Impaired mucociliary clearance
  - Immune modulation
- **Common viruses**: RSV, influenza, adenovirus, rhinovirus

#### Biofilm Formation
- **Mucosal biofilms**: Bacteria in protective matrix
- **Consequences**:
  - Antibiotic resistance
  - Recurrent infections
  - Persistent effusion

### Risk Factors

#### Host Factors
- **Age**: <2 years highest risk
- **Genetics**: Family history, Native American, Alaskan Native ancestry
- **Immunodeficiency**: Congenital or acquired
- **Craniofacial abnormalities**: Cleft palate, Down syndrome
- **Gender**: Slightly more common in males

#### Environmental Factors
- **Day care attendance**: 2-3× increased risk
- **Lack of breastfeeding**: Protective effect of breastfeeding through 6 months
- **Tobacco smoke exposure**: Passive smoke exposure
- **Pacifier use**: After age 6 months
- **Bottle propping**: Feeding while supine
- **Season**: Fall and winter peaks

#### Medical Factors
- **Recent URI**: Within preceding 2 weeks
- **Allergic rhinitis**: Eustachian tube dysfunction
- **Gastroesophageal reflux**: Controversial association
- **Previous AOM**: History increases recurrence risk

### Clinical Presentation

#### Symptoms
- **Otalgia**: Ear pain, may pull at ear (infants)
- **Fever**: Present in 50-60%
- **Irritability**: Especially infants and toddlers
- **Sleep disturbance**: Pain worse at night
- **Decreased hearing**: Conductive hearing loss from effusion
- **Otorrhea**: If tympanic membrane perforation
- **Associated URI symptoms**: Rhinorrhea, cough, congestion

#### Signs (Essential for Diagnosis)

**AAO-HNS 2013 Diagnostic Criteria (all required):**
1. **Acute onset**: Symptom onset within 48 hours
2. **Middle ear effusion (MEE)**: Demonstrated by:
   - Bulging tympanic membrane, OR
   - Limited/absent TM mobility on pneumatic otoscopy, OR
   - Otorrhea (not from external otitis), OR
   - Air-fluid level behind TM
3. **Middle ear inflammation**: Signs include:
   - Distinct erythema of TM
   - Distinct otalgia interfering with activity/sleep

**Tympanic membrane findings:**
- **Color**: Erythema (may be diffuse or localized), yellow (pus), white (effusion)
- **Position**: Bulging (hallmark of AOM), full, neutral
- **Mobility**: Reduced or absent on pneumatic otoscopy (most sensitive finding)
- **Translucency**: Opaque (effusion/pus), air-fluid level, bubbles
- **Perforation**: Visible hole with purulent drainage

#### Otoscopic Pitfalls
- **Crying**: Can cause TM erythema without infection
- **Cerumen**: May obscure view (remove if necessary)
- **Myringitis**: Inflammation of TM only (viral, not bacterial)
- **Otitis externa**: External canal inflammation (different treatment)

### Diagnosis

#### Essential Tools
- **Pneumatic otoscopy**: Gold standard for detecting effusion
  - Apply positive and negative pressure
  - Normal TM moves briskly
  - Effusion reduces mobility significantly
- **Otoscope**: Adequate light source, speculum size appropriate for canal
- **Cerumen removal**: If view obscured

#### Adjunctive Tools
- **Tympanometry**: Objective measure of middle ear compliance
  - Type B: Flat (effusion or perforation)
  - Type C: Negative pressure (Eustachian tube dysfunction)
  - Not necessary if pneumatic otoscopy diagnostic
- **Acoustic reflectometry**: Measures sound reflection (less commonly used)

#### Differential Diagnosis
- **Otitis media with effusion**: No acute inflammation signs
- **Otitis externa**: Canal inflammation, pain with tragal/pinna manipulation
- **Viral myringitis**: TM inflammation without effusion
- **TMJ dysfunction**: Referred ear pain
- **Dental pain**: Referred to ear
- **Cerumen impaction**: Fullness, conductive hearing loss

### Treatment

#### Observation (Watchful Waiting)

**AAO-HNS 2013 Criteria for Observation:**
- **Age ≥24 months**, AND
- **Unilateral AOM**, AND
- **Non-severe illness**: No severe otalgia, fever <39°C (102.2°F)
- **Ensure**: 48-hour follow-up available

**Observation period**: 48-72 hours with analgesics
**Antibiotics**: If no improvement or worsening

**Rationale:**
- 60-80% of AOM resolves spontaneously
- Reduce antibiotic overuse and resistance
- Most benefit in older children with milder disease

#### Antibiotic Therapy

**Indications for immediate antibiotics:**
- **Age <6 months**: All cases
- **Age 6-23 months**: All with definite diagnosis
- **Age ≥24 months with:**
  - Bilateral AOM
  - Severe illness (moderate/severe otalgia, fever ≥39°C)
  - Otorrhea from perforation
- **Any age**: Immunocompromised, craniofacial abnormalities

**First-line antibiotic:**
- **Amoxicillin**: 80-90 mg/kg/day divided BID × 10 days (<2 years) or 5-7 days (≥2 years)
- **Rationale**: Covers most S. pneumoniae, well-tolerated, inexpensive

**High-dose rationale:**
- Overcome pneumococcal resistance
- Achieve MIC in middle ear

**Amoxicillin-clavulanate (Augmentin):**
- **Indications**:
  - Amoxicillin failure after 48-72 hours
  - AOM within past 30 days
  - Concurrent purulent conjunctivitis
  - Higher β-lactamase producing organism prevalence
- **Dose**: 90 mg/kg/day amoxicillin component, divided BID
- **Formulation**: Use 14:1 ratio (reduces diarrhea)

**Alternative antibiotics (if penicillin allergy):**

**Non-severe allergy (non-anaphylactic):**
- Cefdinir: 14 mg/kg/day BID
- Cefuroxime: 30 mg/kg/day BID
- Cefpodoxime: 10 mg/kg/day divided BID

**Severe allergy (anaphylaxis, Stevens-Johnson):**
- Azithromycin: 10 mg/kg day 1, then 5 mg/kg days 2-5 (efficacy concerns with resistance)
- Clarithromycin: 15 mg/kg/day divided BID (efficacy concerns)

**Treatment failure (persistent symptoms after 48-72 hours):**
1. **First-line failure**: Amoxicillin-clavulanate 90 mg/kg/day
2. **Second failure**: Consider:
   - Ceftriaxone: 50 mg/kg IM daily × 1-3 days
   - Tympanocentesis for culture
   - Consultation

#### Duration of Therapy
- **Age <2 years or severe disease**: 10 days
- **Age 2-5 years, mild-moderate**: 7 days
- **Age ≥6 years, mild-moderate**: 5-7 days

#### Pain Management
- **Essential component**: Analgesics regardless of antibiotic decision
- **Options**:
  - Acetaminophen: 10-15 mg/kg q4-6h
  - Ibuprofen: 10 mg/kg q6-8h
- **Topical agents**: Antipyrine-benzocaine drops (if TM intact) - limited evidence
- **Avoid**: Codeine in children

#### Additional Measures
- **Decongestants/antihistamines**: Not recommended (no proven benefit)
- **Steroids**: Not recommended
- **Complementary therapies**: Insufficient evidence

### Follow-Up
- **Clinical follow-up**: Not routinely needed if improving
- **Persistent symptoms**: Re-examine at 48-72 hours
- **Audiometry**: If OME persists >3 months after AOM

### Complications

#### Common
- **Tympanic membrane perforation**: 5-10% of AOM cases
  - Usually small, heals spontaneously
  - Keep ear dry
  - Most close within weeks
- **Persistent effusion**: 40% at 1 month, 10-25% at 3 months

#### Suppurative Complications (Rare since antibiotics)

**Mastoiditis:**
- **Incidence**: 1-2 per 100,000 children
- **Presentation**: Postauricular swelling, erythema, tenderness, protrusion of auricle
- **Imaging**: CT temporal bone (coalescence of mastoid air cells, subperiosteal abscess)
- **Treatment**: IV antibiotics (ceftriaxone ± vancomycin), possible mastoidectomy

**Intracranial:**
- **Meningitis**: Extension through tegmen or hematogenous
- **Brain abscess**: Temporal lobe or cerebellum
- **Lateral sinus thrombosis**: Presents with headache, papilledema
- **Epidural/subdural abscess**: Rare

**Other:**

- **Facial nerve paralysis**: 0.5% of AOM cases, usually recovers
- **Petrositis**: Apex of petrous bone infection (Gradenigo syndrome: CN VI palsy, facial pain, otorrhea)

## Otitis Media with Effusion (OME)

### Definition
Fluid in middle ear without signs or symptoms of acute infection.

### Pathophysiology
- **Eustachian tube dysfunction**: Primary mechanism
- **Negative middle ear pressure**: Transudation of fluid
- **Post-AOM**: Residual effusion after infection resolves
- **Inflammatory mediators**: Persist in middle ear fluid
- **Ciliary dysfunction**: Impaired clearance

### Clinical Presentation
- **Asymptomatic**: Often discovered incidentally
- **Hearing loss**: Mild to moderate conductive (usually 20-30 dB)
- **Aural fullness**: Sensation of "plugged" ear
- **Imbalance**: Occasionally in children
- **No otalgia or fever**: Distinguishes from AOM

### Diagnosis
- **Otoscopy findings**:
  - Amber, gray, or blue TM (not erythematous)
  - Retracted or neutral position
  - Air-fluid level or bubbles (pathognomonic)
  - Reduced mobility on pneumatic otoscopy
- **Tympanometry**: Type B (flat) or C (negative pressure)
- **Audiometry**: Conductive hearing loss if persists >3 months

### Natural History
- **Resolution**: 50% resolve by 1 month, 90% by 3 months
- **Recurrence**: Common in children
- **Chronic**: 30-40% persist >3 months

### Treatment

#### Observation (First-line)
- **Duration**: 3 months for most
- **Monitoring**: Periodic otoscopy
- **Exceptions**: Children with risk factors for developmental delay

#### Medical Management
- **Antibiotics**: Not recommended for routine OME
- **Antihistamines/decongestants**: Not effective
- **Intranasal steroids**: Limited benefit, not routinely recommended
- **Systemic steroids**: Not recommended

#### Surgical Intervention (Tympanostomy Tubes)

**Indications (AAO-HNS guidelines):**
- **Bilateral OME ≥3 months** with documented hearing loss
- **Structural TM damage**: Retraction pocket, adhesive otitis
- **Recurrent AOM**: Meeting criteria for recurrent AOM
- **At-risk children**: Developmental delay, craniofacial abnormalities (earlier intervention)

**Procedure:**
- Myringotomy (incision in TM) + tube insertion
- General anesthesia in children, local in adults
- Tubes ventilate middle ear, allow drainage
- Duration: Short-term tubes (6-12 months), long-term tubes (12-24+ months)

**Outcomes:**
- Immediate improvement in hearing
- Reduced AOM episodes
- Quality of life improvement

**Complications:**
- Otorrhea through tubes (10-20%)
- Tube obstruction/premature extrusion
- Persistent perforation after extrusion (2-3%)
- Tympanosclerosis (scarring, usually insignificant)
- Cholesteatoma (rare, <1%)

#### Adenoidectomy
- **Often performed with tubes**: Especially in older children (≥4 years)
- **Benefit**: Improves Eustachian tube function, reduces recurrence
- **Indications**: Recurrent OME requiring repeat tubes, nasal obstruction

### Impact on Development
- **Speech and language**: Mild delays possible with chronic OME
- **Educational**: "Glue ear" interferes with learning
- **Behavioral**: Inattention from hearing difficulty
- **Usually reversible**: With treatment

## Recurrent Acute Otitis Media

### Definition
≥3 episodes in 6 months OR ≥4 episodes in 12 months with at least 1 in past 6 months.

### Risk Factors
- Same as for AOM, plus:
- First episode before 6 months
- Day care attendance
- Lack of breastfeeding
- Family history

### Management

#### Chemoprophylaxis (Not routinely recommended)
- **Historical use**: Amoxicillin 20 mg/kg/day once daily
- **Current stance**: AAO-HNS recommends against due to:
  - Antibiotic resistance concerns
  - Limited efficacy
  - Adverse effects
- **Rarely considered**: Exceptional cases after discussion

#### Tympanostomy Tubes
- **Recommended**: For recurrent AOM meeting criteria
- **Efficacy**: Reduces episodes by 1-1.5 per 6 months
- **Cost-effective**: Compared to repeated office visits, antibiotics

#### Preventive Measures
- **Pneumococcal vaccination**: PCV13, PPSV23
- **Influenza vaccination**: Annual
- **Reduce risk factors**: Breastfeeding, avoid tobacco smoke, limit day care if possible
- **Xylitol**: Some evidence for prevention (chewing gum in older children)

## Chronic Suppurative Otitis Media (CSOM)

### Definition
Persistent drainage through tympanic membrane perforation for >6 weeks.

### Pathophysiology
- **Persistent perforation**: From AOM or trauma
- **Recurrent infection**: Through perforation
- **Biofilm formation**: Chronic inflammation
- **Cholesteatoma**: May develop

### Microbiology
- **Different from AOM**: Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, anaerobes
- **Polymicrobial**: Often multiple organisms

### Clinical Presentation
- **Persistent otorrhea**: Purulent, foul-smelling
- **Hearing loss**: Conductive, proportional to perforation size
- **Usually painless**: Unless acute exacerbation
- **TM perforation**: Visible on otoscopy

### Treatment

#### Medical Management
- **Aural toilet**: Suction cleaning, essential
- **Topical antibiotics**: Fluoroquinolone otic drops (ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin)
  - Preferred over aminoglycosides (ototoxicity risk)
  - Avoid if labyrinthine fistula present
- **Systemic antibiotics**: If refractory or complications
- **Avoid water**: Keep ear dry (earplugs during bathing)

#### Surgical Management
- **Tympanoplasty**: Repair perforation
- **Mastoidectomy**: If cholesteatoma or mastoid disease
- **Timing**: After infection controlled

### Complications
- **Cholesteatoma**: 50% of CSOM cases
- **Intracranial extension**: Brain abscess, meningitis (rare)
- **Hearing loss**: Progressive if untreated

## Cholesteatoma

### Definition
Abnormal squamous epithelium in middle ear/mastoid, with keratin accumulation.

### Types
- **Congenital**: Epithelial rest behind intact TM
- **Acquired**:
  - Primary: Retraction pocket from negative middle ear pressure
  - Secondary: Through perforation or after surgery

### Pathophysiology
- **Erosion**: Enzymatic bone destruction
- **Expansion**: Progressive growth
- **Infection**: Recurrent if drainage impaired

### Clinical Presentation
- **Otorrhea**: Foul-smelling, persistent
- **Hearing loss**: Conductive initially, may become mixed
- **Retraction pocket**: On otoscopy, often posterosuperior
- **White debris**: Visible keratin
- **Complications**: Facial paralysis, vertigo, intracranial extension (late)

### Diagnosis
- **Otoscopy**: Retraction pocket, white debris, perforation with granulation
- **CT temporal bone**: Soft tissue mass, bony erosion
  - Erosion of scutum, ossicles
  - Mastoid opacification
- **MRI**: Differentiate cholesteatoma from granulation tissue (DWI restriction)

### Treatment
- **Surgical**: Tympanomastoidectomy
  - Canal wall up: Preserve posterior canal wall, preserve anatomy
  - Canal wall down: Remove wall for complete disease removal, requires lifelong cleaning
- **Goals**: Complete removal, prevent recurrence, preserve/restore hearing
- **Second-look**: Often needed to check for residual/recurrent disease

### Prognosis
- **Recurrence**: 10-40% depending on technique
- **Hearing**: Variable outcomes
- **Long-term**: Annual follow-up required

## Prevention Strategies

### Individual Level
- **Breastfeeding**: Exclusive for 6 months recommended
- **Vaccination**: Pneumococcal, influenza
- **Avoid tobacco smoke**: No smoking around children
- **Pacifier**: Limit use after 6 months
- **Feeding position**: Upright bottle feeding

### Public Health
- **Universal pneumococcal vaccination**: PCV13
  - Reduced invasive pneumococcal disease
  - Reduced AOM incidence by 20-30%
  - Serotype replacement occurring
- **Influenza vaccination**: Reduces AOM during flu season
- **Smoke-free environments**: Legislation

## Guidelines Summary

### AAO-HNS 2013 AOM Guidelines
- Stringent diagnostic criteria
- Observation option for appropriate patients
- Amoxicillin first-line
- Analgesic importance emphasized
- Avoid antibiotics for OME

### AAO-HNS 2016 OME Guidelines
- Watchful waiting for 3 months
- No antibiotics, antihistamines, or decongestants
- Tympanostomy tubes for chronic OME with hearing loss
- Hearing evaluation for persistent OME

## Summary

Otitis media represents a spectrum of middle ear diseases from acute bacterial infection to chronic effusion. Acute otitis media requires accurate diagnosis using pneumatic otoscopy demonstrating middle ear effusion and signs of inflammation. Treatment includes observation for appropriate patients or antibiotics (amoxicillin first-line) with essential pain management. Complications are rare but serious. Otitis media with effusion is common after AOM, usually resolves spontaneously within 3 months, and does not require antibiotics. Tympanostomy tubes are indicated for chronic OME with hearing loss or recurrent AOM. Prevention through vaccination, breastfeeding, and reducing risk factors is important. Understanding evidence-based management, including appropriate use of observation and antibiotics, helps optimize outcomes while reducing antibiotic resistance. Regular follow-up and recognition of complications ensure comprehensive care for patients with otitis media.
