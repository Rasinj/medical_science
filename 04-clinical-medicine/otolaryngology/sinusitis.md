# Sinusitis (Rhinosinusitis)

## Overview

Rhinosinusitis, commonly referred to as sinusitis, is inflammation of the paranasal sinuses and nasal cavity. It affects approximately 1 in 8 adults annually in the United States, resulting in over 30 million diagnoses per year. The condition represents a significant healthcare burden with billions spent on medical care and lost productivity. Rhinosinusitis is classified as acute (lasting <4 weeks), subacute (4-12 weeks), or chronic (>12 weeks). Most cases are viral and self-limited, but bacterial sinusitis requires appropriate antibiotic therapy. Understanding the distinction between viral and bacterial disease, recognizing complications, and applying evidence-based management are critical for optimal patient care.

### Epidemiology
- **Prevalence**: 12-16% of adults annually
- **Healthcare impact**: 1-2% of all physician visits
- **Economic burden**: $3-5 billion annually in direct costs
- **Pediatric**: 5-10% of upper respiratory infections complicated by sinusitis
- **Chronic rhinosinusitis**: Affects 10-15% of US population
- **Gender**: Slightly more common in women

### Classification

#### By Duration
- **Acute rhinosinusitis (ARS)**: <4 weeks
  - Viral (acute viral rhinosinusitis): Most common
  - Bacterial (acute bacterial rhinosinusitis, ABRS): 0.5-2% of viral URIs
- **Subacute**: 4-12 weeks
- **Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS)**: >12 weeks
- **Recurrent acute**: ≥4 episodes per year, symptom-free intervals

#### By Etiology
- **Viral**: 90-98% of acute rhinosinusitis
- **Bacterial**: 0.5-2% of acute cases
- **Fungal**: Immunocompromised, invasive disease; allergic fungal sinusitis
- **Allergic**: Inflammatory component

## Anatomy and Physiology

### Paranasal Sinuses

#### Maxillary Sinuses
- **Location**: Within maxillary bone, below orbit
- **Largest**: Pyramidal shape, 15 mL volume
- **Drainage**: Via maxillary ostium to middle meatus
- **Development**: Present at birth, pneumatize throughout childhood
- **Clinical**: Most commonly infected sinus

#### Frontal Sinuses
- **Location**: Within frontal bone, above orbits
- **Variable**: Size varies greatly, sometimes asymmetric or absent
- **Drainage**: Via frontal recess to middle meatus
- **Development**: Begin pneumatization age 5-8 years
- **Clinical**: Complications include orbital and intracranial extension

#### Ethmoid Sinuses
- **Location**: Between orbits, multiple air cells (3-18 each side)
- **Anterior ethmoid**: Drain to middle meatus
- **Posterior ethmoid**: Drain to superior meatus
- **Development**: Present at birth
- **Clinical**: Proximity to orbit makes orbital complications common

#### Sphenoid Sinuses
- **Location**: Within sphenoid bone, behind ethmoids
- **Neurovascular proximity**: Carotid artery, optic nerve, pituitary, cavernous sinus
- **Drainage**: Via sphenoethmoidal recess
- **Development**: Pneumatize age 3-4 years
- **Clinical**: Isolated sphenoid sinusitis rare but potentially serious

### Osteomeatal Complex (OMC)
- **Key anatomic region**: Common drainage pathway for maxillary, frontal, anterior ethmoid
- **Components**: Middle meatus, uncinate process, ethmoid infundibulum, hiatus semilunaris, ethmoid bulla
- **Obstruction**: Leads to impaired drainage and sinusitis
- **Variations**: Concha bullosa, paradoxical middle turbinate, Haller cells

### Mucociliary Clearance

#### Normal Function
- **Ciliated columnar epithelium**: Lines sinuses and nasal cavity
- **Mucus layer**: Two-layer system (sol and gel layers)
- **Ciliary beat**: 10-15 Hz, coordinated toward ostia
- **Mucus transport**: 5-10 mm/minute normally
- **Defense**: Traps particles, bacteria; propels toward nasopharynx

#### Dysfunction in Sinusitis
- **Viral infection**: Damages ciliated epithelium
- **Inflammation**: Edema obstructs ostia
- **Stasis**: Mucus accumulation
- **Bacterial overgrowth**: Static secretions infected
- **Cycle**: Further inflammation and obstruction

## Acute Rhinosinusitis

### Pathophysiology

#### Viral ARS (Common Cold)
- **Viruses**: Rhinovirus (50%), coronavirus, influenza, parainfluenza, adenovirus, RSV
- **Mechanism**:
  - Direct viral invasion of respiratory epithelium
  - Ciliary dysfunction and epithelial damage
  - Inflammatory mediators released
  - Mucosal edema and increased secretions
  - Ostial obstruction
- **Secondary bacterial infection**: 0.5-2% progress to ABRS

#### Bacterial ARS (ABRS)
- **Common pathogens**:
  - Streptococcus pneumoniae: 20-40%
  - Haemophilus influenzae: 20-30%
  - Moraxella catarrhalis: 10-20%
  - Streptococcus pyogenes: 5%
  - Staphylococcus aureus: 5%
  - Anaerobes: Dental origin, chronic
- **Mechanism**:
  - Ostial obstruction from viral infection
  - Stagnant secretions
  - Decreased oxygen tension
  - Bacterial proliferation
  - Purulent infection

### Risk Factors
- **Recent viral URI**: Preceding cold in 80%
- **Allergic rhinitis**: Chronic inflammation, obstruction
- **Anatomic variants**: Deviated septum, concha bullosa, narrow OMC
- **Nasal polyps**: Obstruction
- **Dental infection**: Odontogenic sinusitis (maxillary)
- **Smoking**: Impairs mucociliary clearance
- **Swimming/diving**: Barotrauma, water contamination
- **Immunodeficiency**: Humoral or cellular
- **Cystic fibrosis**: Thick secretions, chronic infection

### Clinical Presentation

#### Symptoms
**Major criteria:**
- **Purulent nasal discharge**: Thick, colored (yellow, green)
- **Nasal obstruction/congestion**: Difficulty breathing through nose
- **Facial pain/pressure**: Over affected sinus
- **Hyposmia/anosmia**: Reduced sense of smell

**Minor criteria:**
- **Headache**: Frontal or generalized
- **Halitosis**: Bad breath
- **Fatigue/malaise**: Systemic symptoms
- **Dental pain**: Maxillary sinusitis
- **Cough**: From postnasal drainage
- **Ear pressure/fullness**: Eustachian tube involvement
- **Fever**: Variable, more common in children

#### Distinguishing Viral from Bacterial ARS

**Bacterial ARS suggested by:**
1. **Persistent symptoms**: ≥10 days without improvement
2. **Severe symptoms**: High fever (≥39°C), purulent discharge, facial pain ≥3-4 consecutive days at illness onset
3. **Worsening symptoms** ("double sickening"): Initial improvement then worsening after 5-6 days

**Viral ARS typical course:**
- Peak symptoms days 3-6
- Improvement by day 7-10
- Resolve by 10-14 days
- Symptoms generally mild to moderate

### Diagnosis

#### Clinical Diagnosis (Primary)
- **History and physical examination**: Sufficient for most cases
- **Diagnostic criteria**: ≥2 major symptoms OR 1 major + ≥2 minor symptoms

#### Physical Examination
- **Anterior rhinoscopy**: Purulent discharge in middle meatus
- **Percussion/palpation**: Tenderness over affected sinus
- **Transillumination**: Limited utility, rarely performed
- **Nasal endoscopy**: If available, visualize middle meatus drainage
- **Pharynx**: Postnasal drip, erythema
- **Complications**: Periorbital swelling, cranial nerve deficits, altered mental status

#### Imaging

**NOT recommended routinely for uncomplicated ARS**

**CT paranasal sinuses:**
- **Indications**:
  - Suspected complications
  - Recurrent ABRS
  - Persistent symptoms despite treatment
  - Pre-surgical evaluation
  - Immunocompromised
- **Findings**: Air-fluid levels, mucosal thickening, complete opacification
- **Note**: Viral URI also causes mucosal thickening (low specificity)

**MRI:**
- **Indications**: Suspected fungal sinusitis, orbital/intracranial complications, tumor

**Plain radiographs:**
- **Not recommended**: Low sensitivity and specificity, replaced by CT

#### Laboratory Testing
- **Not routinely recommended**: Clinical diagnosis sufficient
- **Consider**: If immunocompromised or severe disease

### Treatment

#### Viral ARS (Symptomatic Treatment)

**Intranasal corticosteroids:**
- **Examples**: Fluticasone, mometasone, budesonide
- **Dose**: 1-2 sprays each nostril daily
- **Evidence**: Modest symptom improvement
- **Duration**: Continue until symptom resolution

**Nasal saline irrigation:**
- **High-volume**: 150-250 mL each side
- **Evidence**: Reduces symptoms, improves clearance
- **Safety**: Use distilled, sterile, or boiled/cooled water
- **Frequency**: 1-2 times daily

**Analgesics/antipyretics:**
- **Acetaminophen or ibuprofen**: Pain and fever relief
- **Dose**: Standard dosing

**Decongestants:**

- **Bent-Kuhn criteria**: CRS + nasal polyposis + eosinophilic mucin + fungal on stain/culture + Type I hypersensitivity to fungi
- **Imaging**: Heterogeneous opacification, bone expansion/erosion
- **Treatment**: Surgery + systemic steroids + topical steroids, antifungals not beneficial
- **Recurrence**: Common, requires long-term management

#### Invasive Fungal Sinusitis
- **Acute fulminant**: Immunocompromised (neutropenia, diabetes, transplant)
- **Organisms**: Aspergillus, Mucor, Rhizopus
- **Presentation**: Rapidly progressive, tissue invasion, orbital/intracranial extension
- **Treatment**: EMERGENCY - surgical debridement + IV antifungals (amphotericin B) + reverse immunosuppression
- **Prognosis**: High mortality without prompt treatment

#### Aspirin-Exacerbated Respiratory Disease (AERD, Samter's Triad)
- **Components**: Asthma + nasal polyps + aspirin/NSAID sensitivity
- **Pathophysiology**: Altered arachidonic acid metabolism, cysteinyl leukotriene overproduction
- **Management**:
  - Avoid aspirin/NSAIDs (triggers reactions)
  - Intranasal steroids, systemic steroids, leukotriene modifiers
  - FESS often required
  - Aspirin desensitization: In specialized centers, reduces polyp recurrence

## Summary

Rhinosinusitis is extremely common, affecting millions annually. Most acute rhinosinusitis is viral and self-limited, managed with symptomatic treatment including intranasal corticosteroids and nasal saline irrigation. Bacterial acute rhinosinusitis develops in 0.5-2% of viral infections, diagnosed by persistent symptoms (≥10 days), severe symptoms, or worsening after initial improvement. Amoxicillin-clavulanate is first-line antibiotic therapy for 5-7 days. Complications including orbital and intracranial extension are rare but require urgent intervention. Chronic rhinosinusitis persists ≥12 weeks, significantly impairs quality of life, and is classified by presence or absence of nasal polyps. Medical management with intranasal steroids and saline irrigation is first-line, with functional endoscopic sinus surgery reserved for refractory cases. Understanding the distinction between viral and bacterial disease, applying evidence-based antibiotic stewardship, recognizing complications, and appropriately managing chronic disease are essential for optimal care of patients with rhinosinusitis.
