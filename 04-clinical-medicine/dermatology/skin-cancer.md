# Skin Cancer

## Overview

Skin cancer is the most common malignancy in humans, with incidence rates continuing to rise globally. The three main types—melanoma, basal cell carcinoma (BCC), and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)—arise from different cell types within the epidermis and have distinct clinical behaviors, prognoses, and treatment approaches. Early detection and treatment are crucial for optimal outcomes, particularly for melanoma, which accounts for the majority of skin cancer deaths despite representing a minority of cases.

### Epidemiology
- **Incidence**: Over 5 million cases of non-melanoma skin cancer annually in the US
- **Melanoma**: ~100,000 new cases annually in the US, rising incidence
- **Mortality**: Melanoma causes ~7,000 deaths annually in the US
- **Distribution**: Most common in fair-skinned populations in areas with high UV exposure
- **Age**: Incidence increases with age, though melanoma can occur at any age

### Risk Factors (General)
- **UV exposure**: Cumulative and intense intermittent (sunburns)
- **Skin type**: Fitzpatrick I-II (fair skin, light hair, light eyes)
- **History**: Personal or family history of skin cancer
- **Immunosuppression**: Organ transplant recipients, chronic lymphocytic leukemia
- **Genetic syndromes**: Xeroderma pigmentosum, basal cell nevus syndrome, familial melanoma
- **Age**: Increasing risk with age
- **Ionizing radiation**: Previous radiation therapy

## Melanoma

### Definition and Classification
Melanoma is a malignant tumor of melanocytes with potential for aggressive local invasion, regional lymph node spread, and distant metastasis. It represents only 1% of skin cancers but causes the majority of skin cancer deaths.

### Pathophysiology

#### Genetic Factors
- **BRAF mutations**: Present in ~50% of melanomas (V600E most common)
- **NRAS mutations**: 15-20% of melanomas
- **CDKN2A**: Familial melanoma, increased risk 20-40 fold
- **MC1R variants**: Red hair, fair skin, increased melanoma risk
- **Chromosomal changes**: Loss of 9p, 10q; gain of 7, 20q

#### UV Radiation
- **DNA damage**: Thymine dimers, oxidative stress
- **Mutation accumulation**: Particularly in tumor suppressor genes
- **Intermittent intense exposure**: Strong association with melanoma risk
- **Sunburns in childhood**: Particularly increase risk
- **UVA and UVB**: Both contribute to carcinogenesis

#### Immune Surveillance
- **Immune evasion**: Melanoma can evade immune recognition
- **PD-1/PD-L1**: Checkpoint proteins exploited by melanoma
- **CTLA-4**: Another checkpoint pathway
- **Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes**: Prognostic significance

### Clinical Subtypes

#### Superficial Spreading Melanoma
- **Prevalence**: 70% of melanomas
- **Demographics**: Middle-aged adults
- **Location**: Trunk (men), legs (women)
- **Growth**: Radial growth phase precedes vertical growth
- **Appearance**: Asymmetric, irregular borders, color variegation
- **Prognosis**: Depends on Breslow depth at diagnosis

#### Nodular Melanoma
- **Prevalence**: 15-30% of melanomas
- **Growth pattern**: Vertical growth from onset (no radial phase)
- **Appearance**: Dark (blue-black) nodule, often uniform
- **Bleeding/ulceration**: Common
- **Prognosis**: Often presents at advanced stage, worse prognosis
- **Location**: Trunk, head, neck

#### Lentigo Maligna Melanoma
- **Prevalence**: 5-15% of melanomas
- **Demographics**: Elderly patients
- **Location**: Chronically sun-damaged skin (face, ears, neck)
- **Precursor**: Lentigo maligna (melanoma in situ)
- **Appearance**: Large, irregularly pigmented macule or patch
- **Evolution**: Slow, may take years to develop invasion
- **Prognosis**: Better than other types due to earlier detection

#### Acral Lentiginous Melanoma
- **Prevalence**: 5% of melanomas overall, 30-70% in dark-skinned individuals
- **Location**: Palms, soles, subungual areas
- **Demographics**: Equal incidence across races
- **Appearance**: Irregular pigmented macule or patch
- **Subungual**: Longitudinal melanonychia, Hutchinson sign (pigment on cuticle)
- **Prognosis**: Often diagnosed late, worse outcomes

- **High-risk features**: Varies by features, 70-90%
- **Metastatic SCC**: 25-50% 5-year survival (improving with immunotherapy)

#### Recurrence Rates
- **Adequate excision**: 2-5%
- **High-risk features**: 10-30%
- **Immunosuppressed**: Higher rates

### Surveillance

**Low-Risk:**
- **Follow-up**: Every 6-12 months for 2 years, then annually
- **Physical exam**: Skin and regional lymph nodes

**High-Risk:**
- **Follow-up**: Every 3-6 months for first 2 years, then every 6-12 months
- **Imaging**: Consider CT or PET-CT for very high-risk (perineural invasion, recurrent)
- **Lymph node palpation**: Each visit

**Immunosuppressed:**
- **Frequent exams**: Every 3-6 months indefinitely
- **Dermatology co-management**
- **Consider**: Reduced immunosuppression if possible

## Prevention of Skin Cancer

### Sun Protection
- **Avoid peak hours**: 10 AM - 4 PM when UV intensity highest
- **Seek shade**: Umbrellas, trees, shelters
- **Protective clothing**: Long sleeves, wide-brimmed hats, UV-protective clothing
- **Sunglasses**: UV-protective
- **Sunscreen**:
  - Broad-spectrum (UVA and UVB)
  - SPF 30 or higher
  - Apply generously (1 oz for full body), reapply every 2 hours and after swimming
- **Avoid tanning beds**: Associated with melanoma risk, especially if used before age 35

### Skin Examinations
- **Self-examination**: Monthly, check entire skin surface with mirrors
- **Professional examination**: Annual full-body skin exams
- **High-risk patients**: More frequent exams (every 3-6 months)
- **Photography**: Total body photography for high-risk or multiple atypical nevi

### Chemoprevention

**Nicotinamide (Vitamin B3):**
- **Dose**: 500 mg twice daily
- **Indication**: History of multiple non-melanoma skin cancers
- **Efficacy**: 23% reduction in new BCC and SCC in high-risk patients
- **Mechanism**: Enhances DNA repair, reduces UV-induced immunosuppression

**Retinoids:**
- **Acitretin**: For severe actinic damage, organ transplant recipients
- **Low-dose**: 10-25 mg daily
- **Side effects**: Teratogenicity, mucocutaneous dryness, lipid elevation
- **Benefit**: Reduces SCC in high-risk patients while taking (returns after stopping)

**Other:**
- **NSAIDs**: Possible protective effect (epidemiologic data)
- **Statins**: Conflicting evidence

### High-Risk Population Management
- **Organ transplant recipients**:
  - Frequent surveillance
  - Sun protection education
  - Consider chemoprevention (retinoids)
  - Minimize immunosuppression if possible
- **Previous skin cancer**:
  - Regular surveillance
  - Consider nicotinamide
  - Aggressive sun protection

## Key Points

- Melanoma accounts for majority of skin cancer deaths despite representing small percentage of cases; early detection via ABCDE criteria and dermoscopy is crucial
- Breslow depth is the most important prognostic factor in melanoma; surgical excision with appropriate margins based on depth is standard treatment
- Immunotherapy and targeted therapy have revolutionized treatment of advanced melanoma, significantly improving survival
- Basal cell carcinoma is the most common cancer in humans but rarely metastasizes; treatment selection depends on risk stratification
- Mohs micrographic surgery offers highest cure rates and tissue preservation for high-risk BCC and SCC on cosmetically sensitive areas
- Squamous cell carcinoma has metastatic potential (2-5% overall, higher with high-risk features); aggressive treatment warranted for high-risk disease
- Sun protection is paramount for prevention: avoid midday sun, use broad-spectrum sunscreen SPF 30+, protective clothing, avoid tanning beds
- Regular surveillance critical for patients with history of skin cancer due to high risk of developing additional cancers
- Immunosuppressed patients have dramatically increased risk and more aggressive skin cancers requiring careful monitoring
- Patient education on self-skin examination and recognition of warning signs can facilitate early detection and improve outcomes
