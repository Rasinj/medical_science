# Cataracts

## Overview

A cataract is an opacity of the crystalline lens that impairs vision. It is the leading cause of reversible blindness worldwide, affecting over 65 million people. Age-related cataracts are the most common form, though cataracts can develop from various causes including trauma, medications, systemic diseases, and congenital factors. Cataract surgery is one of the most commonly performed and successful surgical procedures, with excellent visual outcomes in most patients. Understanding lens anatomy, cataract pathophysiology, clinical evaluation, and modern surgical techniques is essential for comprehensive patient care.

### Epidemiology
- **Prevalence**: Present in 50% of people age 65-74, >70% over age 75
- **Global burden**: Leading cause of blindness worldwide (51% of world blindness)
- **Incidence**: 20 million cataract surgeries performed annually worldwide
- **Age-related**: Virtually universal with sufficient longevity
- **Economic impact**: Significant healthcare costs, but highly cost-effective treatment
- **Visual restoration**: >95% of patients achieve improved vision

### Classification
- **Age-related (senile)**: Most common, >90% of cases
- **Congenital**: Present at birth
- **Traumatic**: Following ocular injury
- **Secondary**: Due to medications, inflammation, other eye diseases
- **Metabolic**: Diabetes, galactosemia, Wilson disease
- **Radiation-induced**: Ionizing radiation, infrared

## Lens Anatomy and Physiology

### Normal Lens Structure

#### Anatomic Components
- **Lens capsule**: Basement membrane, thickest anteriorly
  - Anterior capsule: 10-15 micrometers
  - Posterior capsule: 2-4 micrometers
  - Composed of type IV collagen
  - Elastic properties allow shape change with accommodation

- **Lens epithelium**: Single layer anteriorly
  - Germinative zone: Equatorial region
  - Central epithelium: Metabolically active
  - No posterior epithelium

- **Lens cortex**: Newer lens fibers
  - Formed throughout life
  - Surrounds nucleus
  - Anterior and posterior cortex

- **Lens nucleus**: Embryonic and fetal nucleus centrally
  - Infantile nucleus
  - Adult nucleus
  - Continues to form with age

#### Lens Fibers
- **Elongated cells**: Lose nuclei and organelles
- **Crystallins**: Structural proteins (90% of dry weight)
  - Alpha-crystallin: Chaperone function
  - Beta-crystallin: Structural
  - Gamma-crystallin: Structural
- **Arrangement**: Onion-like layers
- **Suture lines**: Y-sutures (upright Y anterior, inverted Y posterior)

### Lens Metabolism

#### Energy Production
- **Anaerobic glycolysis**: Primary energy source
- **Glucose**: Enters lens via facilitated diffusion
- **Limited mitochondria**: Mature fibers lack organelles
- **ATP production**: For active transport, protein synthesis

#### Maintaining Transparency
- **Crystallin arrangement**: Regular protein spacing prevents light scatter
- **Minimal organelles**: Lack of nuclei, mitochondria in fiber cells
- **Dehydration**: Active transport maintains 65% water content
- **Antioxidant systems**: Glutathione, ascorbate, superoxide dismutase
- **Na-K-ATPase**: Maintains ionic balance

#### Accommodation (Young Lens)
- **Ciliary muscle contraction**: Relaxes zonules
- **Lens shape change**: Increased anterior convexity
- **Increased power**: Allows near focusing
- **Age-related loss**: Presbyopia from lens stiffening

## Age-Related Cataracts

### Pathophysiology

#### Oxidative Damage
- **Free radicals**: From UV light, normal metabolism
- **Protein oxidation**: Crosslinking of crystallins
- **Lipid peroxidation**: Membrane damage
- **Glutathione depletion**: Reduced antioxidant capacity with age
- **Ascorbate reduction**: Lower levels in cataractous lenses

#### Protein Changes
- **Aggregation**: High molecular weight crystallin aggregates
- **Insolubilization**: Shift from soluble to insoluble protein
- **Yellowing**: Chromophore accumulation
- **Loss of chaperone function**: Alpha-crystallin dysfunction
- **Post-translational modifications**: Glycation, deamidation, phosphorylation

#### Cellular Changes
- **Increased water content**: Hydration of cortex
- **Membrane disruption**: Gap junction breakdown
- **Epithelial cell dysfunction**: Reduced pump activity
- **Calcium increase**: Disturbed homeostasis

### Risk Factors

#### Non-Modifiable
- **Age**: Most important risk factor, exponential increase after 50
- **Gender**: Women slightly higher risk
- **Genetics**: Familial clustering, specific genes identified
- **Ethnicity**: Vary by type (cortical more common in African ancestry)
- **Eye color**: Darker eyes may have different risk

#### Modifiable
- **UV exposure**: Increased risk with chronic exposure
- **Smoking**: 2-3× increased risk, dose-dependent
- **Alcohol**: Heavy consumption increases risk
- **Obesity**: BMI >30 associated with increased risk
- **Diabetes**: 2-5× increased risk, earlier onset
- **Hypertension**: Modest increased risk
- **Steroid use**: Posterior subcapsular cataract
- **Nutritional deficiencies**: Low antioxidant intake

#### Ocular Factors
- **Myopia**: Increased risk of posterior subcapsular and nuclear cataracts
- **Previous eye surgery**: Vitrectomy, glaucoma procedures
- **Chronic uveitis**: Inflammation leads to cataract
- **Trauma**: Even remote injury

### Types of Age-Related Cataracts

- **Glare testing**: May reveal functional impairment despite good acuity

#### Slit-Lamp Examination
- **Direct illumination**: Overall lens appearance
- **Retroillumination**: See opacities against red reflex
- **Grading**: LOCS III or similar system
- **Type classification**: Nuclear, cortical, PSC, mixed

#### Additional Testing

**Refraction:**
- Current best-corrected visual acuity
- Changes from previous prescriptions
- Myopic shift with nuclear sclerosis

**Contrast sensitivity:**
- Better predictor of functional impairment than Snellen acuity
- Pelli-Robson or similar test

**Glare testing:**
- Brightness acuity test (BAT)
- Functional assessment

**Pupil examination:**
- Rule out afferent pupillary defect (suggests other pathology)

**Intraocular pressure:**
- Phacomorphic glaucoma (rare)
- Phacolytic glaucoma (hypermature cataract)

**Dilated fundus exam:**
- Rule out other causes of vision loss
- Assess for diabetic retinopathy, macular degeneration, glaucoma
- Predict postoperative visual potential

#### Biometry for IOL Calculation

- **Examination of posterior segment**: Cataract obscuring view of retina
- **Refractive indication**: Desire to reduce spectacle dependence

#### Timing
- **Patient-centered**: Based on symptoms and functional needs
- **No benefit to waiting**: "Ripening" not necessary with modern techniques
- **Earlier surgery**: Safer, easier, better outcomes than waiting for maturity

### Cataract Surgery

#### Preoperative Assessment

**Medical history:**

## Congenital Cataracts

### Etiology

#### Genetic
- **Isolated**: Autosomal dominant (most common), recessive, X-linked
- **Syndromic**: Down syndrome, Lowe syndrome, others
- **Chromosomal**: Various chromosomal abnormalities

#### Metabolic
- **Galactosemia**: Oil droplet cataract
- **Hypoglycemia**: Neonatal
- **Hypocalcemia**: Tetany

#### Infectious (TORCH)
- **Rubella**: Most common infectious cause
- **Toxoplasmosis**
- **Cytomegalovirus**
- **Herpes simplex**
- **Syphilis**

#### Idiopathic
- **No identifiable cause**: 40-60% of cases

### Clinical Evaluation

#### Newborn Screening
- **Red reflex test**: Identify opacities
- **Leukocoria**: White pupil (differential includes retinoblastoma)

#### Examination
- **Slit-lamp**: If child cooperative
- **Examination under anesthesia**: If needed for complete evaluation
- **Morphology**: Type and density of cataract
- **Laterality**: Unilateral vs bilateral (different implications)

#### Workup
- **Genetic testing**: Family history, syndromic features
- **Metabolic screening**: Galactosemia, other disorders
- **TORCH titers**: If clinically indicated
- **Pediatric consultation**: Rule out systemic disease

### Amblyopia Risk

#### Critical Period
- **Birth to 8 weeks**: Most critical for monocular visual development
- **First year**: Binocularity develops
- **Up to age 7-9**: Visual system plasticity

#### Unilateral Cataract
- **High amblyopia risk**: Treated as emergency in infants
- **Surgery timing**: Within 6-8 weeks of birth for dense cataract
- **Aggressive amblyopia therapy**: Patching good eye essential

#### Bilateral Cataracts
- **Less urgent**: But still important
- **Depends on density**: Dense bilateral cataracts need early surgery
- **Symmetric amblyopia**: Both eyes equally affected

### Treatment

#### Surgery
- **Lensectomy**: Remove lens and anterior vitreous
- **Posterior capsulotomy and vitrectomy**: Prevent rapid PCO
- **IOL implantation**: Controversial in infants
  - Age >2 years: Generally implant IOL
  - <2 years: Debate regarding IOL vs aphakic correction
  - IATS study: Provided data on outcomes

#### Optical Rehabilitation
- **Contact lenses**: If aphakic (no IOL)
- **Glasses**: High hyperopic correction if no IOL
- **IOL**: Most common in older children

#### Amblyopia Treatment
- **Patching**: Good eye to force use of operated eye
- **Atropine**: Penalization of good eye
- **Full-time spectacle wear**: Essential compliance
- **Long-term**: May need years of therapy

### Prognosis
- **Depends on**:
  - Timing of diagnosis and surgery
  - Density of cataract
  - Unilateral vs bilateral
  - Compliance with amblyopia therapy
  - Associated ocular abnormalities (nystagmus, strabismus, glaucoma)

## Special Situations

### Cataract in Diabetes
- **Earlier onset**: Develop cataracts 10-15 years earlier than non-diabetics
- **Type**: PSC and nuclear sclerosis
- **Refractive changes**: Glucose fluctuations cause myopic shifts
- **Preoperative**: Optimize glucose control
- **Postoperative**: Higher CME risk, slower healing
- **Diabetic retinopathy**: Must be assessed and may need treatment before cataract surgery

### Cataract with Glaucoma
- **Combined surgery**: Cataract + trabeculectomy or tube shunt
- **MIGS**: Cataract surgery with minimally invasive glaucoma surgery
- **Phacoemulsification alone**: May lower IOP modestly (angle-closure, some open-angle)
- **Considerations**: Risk of bleb failure with combined surgery vs two separate surgeries

### Cataract with Corneal Disease
- **Combined surgery**: Cataract + DSEK/DMEK or penetrating keratoplasty
- **Staged**: Cataract first or cornea first (depends on severity)
- **IOL calculation**: Challenging with irregular corneas

### Cataract in Uveitis
- **Control inflammation**: Before surgery
- **Timing**: At least 3 months of quiet
- **Surgical considerations**: Higher complication risk
- **Postoperative**: Aggressive anti-inflammatory therapy

### Traumatic Cataract
- **Timing**: Depends on injury, may be immediate or delayed
- **Assessment**: Rule out occult rupture, retained foreign body
- **Surgery**: May be challenging due to zonular damage, capsule rupture
- **Prognosis**: Depends on extent of other injuries

## Prevention

### Primary Prevention
- **UV protection**: Sunglasses, hats
- **Smoking cessation**: Reduces risk
- **Antioxidant diet**: Fruits, vegetables (evidence mixed for supplements)
- **Diabetes control**: Reduces risk and slows progression
- **Avoid unnecessary steroids**: Use lowest effective dose

### Secondary Prevention
- **Regular eye exams**: Early detection
- **Update glasses**: Maintain function as long as possible
- **Low vision aids**: Magnifiers, lighting

## Summary

Cataracts are the leading cause of reversible blindness worldwide, primarily affecting the elderly but occurring across all age groups. Age-related cataracts result from oxidative damage and protein changes in the lens, leading to nuclear, cortical, or posterior subcapsular opacities. Clinical presentation includes gradual vision loss, glare, and difficulty with activities of daily living. Diagnosis is clinical through slit-lamp examination, with surgery indicated when visual symptoms interfere with function. Modern phacoemulsification with IOL implantation is highly successful, providing excellent visual outcomes in >95% of patients. Complications are rare but include endophthalmitis, PCO, retinal detachment, and CME. Congenital cataracts require early detection and treatment to prevent irreversible amblyopia. Understanding the pathophysiology, evaluation, surgical techniques, and management of complications is essential for all clinicians caring for patients with cataracts.
