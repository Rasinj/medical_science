# Refractive Errors

## Overview

Refractive errors are the most common eye disorders worldwide, affecting approximately 2.3 billion people globally. They occur when the eye cannot clearly focus images from the outside world, resulting in blurred vision. The main types of refractive errors include myopia (nearsightedness), hyperopia (farsightedness), astigmatism, and presbyopia. Understanding the optics of the eye, pathophysiology of refractive errors, and treatment options is essential for proper patient management.

### Epidemiology
- **Prevalence**: Affects approximately 35% of adults worldwide
- **Myopia**: Increasing globally, especially in East Asia (up to 80-90% in some populations)
- **Hyperopia**: More common in children and elderly
- **Astigmatism**: Present in approximately 30% of the population
- **Presbyopia**: Universal after age 45
- **Impact**: Leading cause of visual impairment, but easily correctable

### Classification
- **Axial refractive errors**: Due to abnormal eye length (most common)
- **Refractive refractive errors**: Due to abnormal corneal or lenticular power
- **Spherical errors**: Myopia and hyperopia
- **Cylindrical errors**: Astigmatism
- **Age-related**: Presbyopia

## Optical Principles

### Normal Eye Optics

#### Emmetropia
- **Definition**: Normal refractive state where parallel light focuses on the retina
- **Total power**: Approximately 60 diopters (D)
- **Corneal power**: 43 D (two-thirds of total refractive power)
- **Lens power**: 17 D at rest (variable with accommodation)
- **Axial length**: Approximately 24 mm

#### Components of Refraction
- **Cornea**: Primary refractive surface
- **Aqueous humor**: Refractive index 1.336
- **Crystalline lens**: Variable power through accommodation
- **Vitreous humor**: Refractive index 1.336
- **Retina**: Image-receiving surface

### Accommodation

#### Mechanism
- **Near vision**: Ciliary muscle contraction
- **Lens changes**: Increased convexity, especially anterior surface
- **Power increase**: Up to 14 D in young children
- **Amplitude**: Decreases with age (presbyopia)

#### Factors Affecting Accommodation
- **Age**: Progressive loss starting in childhood
- **Autonomic tone**: Parasympathetic stimulation increases accommodation
- **Medications**: Anticholinergics reduce accommodation
- **Disease**: Diabetes, neurological conditions affect accommodation

## Myopia (Nearsightedness)

### Definition and Classification

#### Definition
Myopia is a refractive error where parallel light rays focus in front of the retina when accommodation is relaxed, resulting in blurred distance vision.

#### Classification by Severity
- **Low myopia**: <3 D
- **Moderate myopia**: 3-6 D
- **High myopia**: >6 D
- **Extreme/pathologic myopia**: >10 D with structural changes

#### Classification by Onset
- **Congenital**: Present at birth
- **Youth-onset**: Develops in school-age children (most common)
- **Early adult-onset**: Develops in late teens to early 20s
- **Late adult-onset**: Rare, often pathologic

### Pathophysiology

#### Axial Myopia (Most Common)
- **Mechanism**: Excessive axial length of the eye
- **Normal length**: 24 mm
- **Myopic eye**: Each 1 mm increase ≈ 3 D of myopia
- **Progression**: Usually stabilizes in early adulthood

- **Absolute**: Cannot be overcome by accommodation

### Pathophysiology

#### Axial Hyperopia (Most Common)
- **Short axial length**: Most common cause
- **Physiologic in infants**: Eyes grow into emmetropia
- **Arrested development**: Persistence into adulthood

#### Refractive Hyperopia
- **Decreased corneal power**: Flat cornea
- **Decreased lens power**: Aphakia, lens subluxation
- **Anterior chamber depth**: Shallow AC increases hyperopia

### Clinical Presentation

#### Symptoms in Children
