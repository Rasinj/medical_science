# Interstitial Lung Disease

## Overview

Interstitial lung diseases (ILDs), also known as diffuse parenchymal lung diseases, comprise a heterogeneous group of over 200 disorders characterized by inflammation and/or fibrosis of the lung interstitium (alveolar walls, perivascular and perilymphatic tissues). These diseases lead to impaired gas exchange, restrictive lung physiology, and progressive dyspnea. ILDs range from self-limited inflammatory conditions to relentlessly progressive fibrotic diseases. Accurate diagnosis requires integration of clinical, radiologic, and histopathologic findings, often through multidisciplinary discussion.

### Classification

**Major categories**:

1. **Idiopathic interstitial pneumonias** (IIPs):
   - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF)
   - Non-specific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP)
   - Cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (COP)
   - Acute interstitial pneumonia (AIP)
   - Respiratory bronchiolitis-ILD (RB-ILD)
   - Desquamative interstitial pneumonia (DIP)
   - Lymphoid interstitial pneumonia (LIP)

2. **ILDs of known cause**:
   - Connective tissue disease-associated ILD (CTD-ILD)
   - Drug-induced ILD
   - Environmental/occupational exposure (asbestosis, silicosis, hypersensitivity pneumonitis)
   - Radiation-induced lung injury

3. **Granulomatous ILDs**:
   - Sarcoidosis
   - Hypersensitivity pneumonitis (chronic form)

4. **Other ILDs**:
   - Pulmonary Langerhans cell histiocytosis
   - Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM)
   - Eosinophilic pneumonias
   - Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis

### Epidemiology

**Overall ILD**:
- Prevalence: 80-90 per 100,000 population
- Incidence: 30-40 per 100,000 per year
- Increasing incidence (improved recognition, aging population)

**Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis**:
- Most common idiopathic interstitial pneumonia
- Incidence: 3-9 per 100,000 per year
- Prevalence: 14-43 per 100,000
- Male predominance (2:1)
- Age: Usually >50 years (median age 66)

**Sarcoidosis**:
- Prevalence: 10-20 per 100,000 (Caucasians), 35-80 per 100,000 (African Americans)
- Peak incidence: 20-40 years

## General Approach to ILD

### Clinical Presentation

**Symptoms** (common to most ILDs):
- **Dyspnea**: Progressive, exertional initially → rest
- **Dry cough**: Nonproductive, persistent
- **Fatigue**
- **Chest discomfort**: Vague, non-pleuritic
- Systemic symptoms (depends on etiology): Fever, weight loss, arthralgias, myalgias

**Physical examination**:
- **Auscultation**: "Velcro" crackles (fine, bibasilar, inspiratory)
  - Characteristic of IPF and fibrotic ILDs
  - Absent in sarcoidosis, hypersensitivity pneumonitis (early)
- **Clubbing**: IPF (50-70%), asbestosis
  - Less common in other ILDs
- **Cyanosis**: Advanced disease with significant hypoxemia
- **Signs of pulmonary hypertension/cor pulmonale**: Elevated JVP, loud P2, right ventricular heave, peripheral edema (late findings)
- **Extrapulmonary findings**: Vary by etiology (skin rash, arthritis, uveitis, lymphadenopathy)

### Diagnostic Evaluation

**History**:
- **Exposure history**:
  - Occupational: Asbestos, silica, coal dust, beryllium, metal dust
  - Environmental: Birds (feathers, droppings), mold, hot tubs
  - Hobbies: Woodworking, farming
- **Medications**: Chemotherapy (bleomycin, methotrexate), amiodarone, nitrofurantoin
- **Smoking history**: Pack-years (IPF, RB-ILD, DIP, pulmonary Langerhans cell histiocytosis)
- **Connective tissue disease symptoms**: Raynaud's, joint pain/swelling, rash, dry eyes/mouth
- **Family history**: Familial pulmonary fibrosis

**Laboratory tests**:
- **Complete blood count**: Anemia, leukocytosis/leukopenia
- **Basic metabolic panel**: Renal function (collagen vascular disease)
- **Liver function tests**: Elevated in sarcoidosis, drug toxicity
- **Autoimmune serologies** (if CTD-ILD suspected):
  - ANA, RF, anti-CCP (rheumatoid arthritis)
  - Anti-Scl-70, anti-centromere (scleroderma)
  - Anti-Ro/La (Sjögren's)
  - Anti-Jo-1, anti-synthetase antibodies (polymyositis/dermatomyositis)
  - Aldolase, CK (myositis)
- **Serum ACE, lysozyme**: Elevated in sarcoidosis (low specificity)
- **Hypersensitivity pneumonitis panel**: Serum precipitins (if exposure suspected)

**Pulmonary function tests**:
- **Spirometry**:
  - **Restrictive pattern**: Reduced FVC, reduced TLC, normal or elevated FEV₁/FVC ratio (≥0.70)
  - May be normal early in disease
- **Lung volumes**: Reduced TLC, reduced VC, reduced FRC, reduced RV
- **Diffusion capacity (DLCO)**: Reduced (hallmark finding)
  - Reflects impaired gas transfer
  - Often earliest and most sensitive abnormality
- **Exercise testing** (6-minute walk test or cardiopulmonary exercise test):
  - Reduced exercise capacity
  - Oxygen desaturation with exertion (early finding)
  - Useful for assessing severity, monitoring, prognosis

**Arterial blood gas**:
- **At rest**: May be normal early
- **With exercise**: Hypoxemia, increased A-a gradient
- **Advanced disease**: Resting hypoxemia, hypocapnia (hyperventilation)

**High-resolution CT (HRCT)** (essential):
- **Gold standard for ILD diagnosis**
- Thin-section (1-2 mm) images
- Supine and prone images (distinguish dependent atelectasis from true disease)
- Expiratory images (assess air trapping in hypersensitivity pneumonitis, bronchiolitis)

**HRCT patterns**:
- **Usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP)**: IPF, chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis, CTD-ILD
  - Honeycombing, reticular pattern, subpleural and basal predominance, traction bronchiectasis
- **Non-specific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP)**: CTD-ILD, idiopathic NSIP
  - Ground-glass opacities, fine reticulation, relative sparing of subpleural regions
- **Organizing pneumonia**: COP, secondary causes
  - Patchy consolidation, peribronchovascular distribution, "reversed halo" sign
- **Ground-glass opacities**: NSIP, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, drug-induced, acute/subacute processes
- **Nodules**: Sarcoidosis (perilymphatic distribution), hypersensitivity pneumonitis (centrilobular)
- **Cysts**: Lymphangioleiomyomatosis, pulmonary Langerhans cell histiocytosis, lymphoid interstitial pneumonia

**Bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL)**:
- **Indications**: Suspected infection, alveolar hemorrhage, eosinophilic pneumonia, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, malignancy, alveolar proteinosis
- **Cell differential**:
  - Normal: Macrophages >85%, lymphocytes <15%, neutrophils <3%, eosinophils <1%
  - Lymphocytosis (>25%): Sarcoidosis, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, drug-induced, CTD-ILD
  - Neutrophilia: IPF, collagen vascular disease, infection
  - Eosinophilia (>25%): Eosinophilic pneumonia, drug reaction
- **CD4/CD8 ratio**:
  - High (>3.5): Sarcoidosis (suggestive but not diagnostic)
  - Low (<1): Hypersensitivity pneumonitis
- **Cultures**: Bacterial, mycobacterial, fungal (exclude infection)
- **Cytology**: Malignant cells, hemosiderin-laden macrophages (hemorrhage)

**Transbronchial biopsy**:
- Limited tissue sample (small, crush artifact)
- Useful for: Sarcoidosis (granulomas), organizing pneumonia, eosinophilic pneumonia, malignancy, infection
- Not adequate for: IPF (requires surgical biopsy for definitive UIP diagnosis)

**Surgical lung biopsy**:
- **Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS)**: Preferred over open biopsy
- **Indications**: Uncertain diagnosis after clinical evaluation, HRCT, BAL
- Multiple biopsies from different lobes (disease often heterogeneous)
- Allows histopathologic pattern diagnosis (UIP, NSIP, organizing pneumonia, etc.)

**Transbronchial cryobiopsy**:
- Emerging technique
- Larger samples than transbronchial forceps biopsy
- Less invasive than surgical biopsy
- Diagnostic yield 70-80%
- Complications: Pneumothorax, bleeding

**Multidisciplinary discussion (MDD)**:
- Integration of clinical, radiologic, pathologic findings
- Pulmonologist, radiologist, pathologist collaboration
- Improves diagnostic accuracy, especially for idiopathic interstitial pneumonias

## Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF)

### Definition

IPF is a specific form of chronic, progressive fibrosing interstitial pneumonia of unknown cause, occurring primarily in older adults, limited to the lungs, and associated with the histopathologic and/or radiologic pattern of usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP).

### Epidemiology

- Most common idiopathic interstitial pneumonia
- Median age at diagnosis: 66 years
- Male predominance: 2:1
- Incidence: 3-9 per 100,000 per year (increasing)
- Median survival: 3-5 years from diagnosis (worse than many cancers)

### Pathophysiology

**Abnormal wound healing**:
- Repetitive alveolar epithelial injury
- Aberrant fibroblast/myofibroblast activation
- Excessive extracellular matrix deposition
- Progressive fibrosis, architectural distortion

**Risk factors**:
- **Age**: >50 years
- **Smoking**: 60-70% of IPF patients have smoking history
- **Genetic factors**: Family history (5%), telomere-related gene mutations (TERT, TERC), MUC5B promoter polymorphism (most common genetic risk factor)
- **Environmental exposures**: Metal dust, wood dust, stone/sand, farming
- **Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)**: Present in >85% of IPF patients (role unclear)
- **Viral infections**: EBV, CMV, hepatitis C (unclear causation)

### Clinical Presentation

**Symptoms**:
- **Progressive dyspnea**: Insidious onset, exertional initially
- **Dry cough**: Persistent, nonproductive (>90%)
- Fatigue, malaise
- **Symptom duration**: Typically >6 months at presentation

**Physical examination**:
- **"Velcro" crackles**: Fine, inspiratory, bibasilar (>90%)
- **Clubbing**: 50-70%
- Cyanosis (advanced disease)
- Signs of pulmonary hypertension/right heart failure (late)

### Diagnosis

**HRCT** (central to diagnosis):

*Definite UIP pattern* (all four features):
- Subpleural and basal predominance
- Reticular abnormality (intralobular lines, irregular interfaces)
- **Honeycombing**: Clustered cystic airspaces, thick walls (hallmark of UIP)
- Absence of features inconsistent with UIP (see below)

*Probable UIP pattern*:
- Subpleural and basal predominance
- Reticular abnormality
- May have mild ground-glass opacities
- Absence of honeycombing

*Indeterminate for UIP*:
- Subpleural and basal predominance
- Subtle reticulation
- No other features

*Alternative diagnosis*:
- Features inconsistent with UIP:
  - Upper/mid-lung predominance
  - Peribronchovascular predominance
  - Extensive ground-glass abnormality (>reticular)
  - Profuse micronodules (bilateral, predominantly upper lobes)
  - Discrete cysts (away from honeycombing)
  - Diffuse mosaic attenuation/air trapping (>3 lobes)
  - Consolidation in bronchopulmonary segments/lobes

**Diagnosis of IPF** (ATS/ERS/JRS/ALAT 2018):

*UIP pattern on HRCT*:
- **Definite UIP**: Diagnosis of IPF (no biopsy needed)
- **Probable UIP**: Diagnosis of IPF if no alternative cause identified; biopsy may be considered
- **Indeterminate or alternative**: Biopsy recommended (if no contraindications)

*Surgical lung biopsy* (if needed):
- **UIP histopathology**:
  - Heterogeneous, patchy fibrosis
  - Fibroblastic foci (active fibrogenesis)
  - Honeycombing (architectural distortion, cystic spaces)
  - Subpleural/paraseptal predominance
  - Temporal heterogeneity (areas of normal lung, active fibrosis, established fibrosis/honeycomb change)
- Absence of features suggesting alternative diagnosis (granulomas, eosinophils, hyaline membranes, organizing pneumonia)

**Exclusion of other causes**:
- No significant exposure history (medications, environmental, occupational)
- No connective tissue disease (serologies may be positive but no clinical CTD)

**Pulmonary function tests**:
- Restrictive pattern: Reduced TLC, FVC
- Reduced DLCO (often disproportionately reduced)
- Normal or elevated FEV₁/FVC ratio
- May show combined restriction and obstruction (emphysema, smoking)

### Treatment

**Antifibrotic therapy** (disease-modifying):

*Nintedanib*:
- Tyrosine kinase inhibitor (VEGFR, PDGFR, FGFR)
- Dose: 150 mg PO BID
- **Efficacy**: Slows decline in FVC by ~50% (reduces ~100 mL decline per year)
- **Side effects**: Diarrhea (60-70%, main side effect), nausea, elevated liver enzymes, weight loss
- Management: Loperamide for diarrhea, dose reduction to 100 mg BID if needed

*Pirfenidone*:
- Anti-inflammatory and antifibrotic properties
- Dose: 801 mg PO TID (titrate up over 2 weeks)
- **Efficacy**: Slows decline in FVC by ~50%
- **Side effects**: Nausea, rash, photosensitivity, elevated liver enzymes
- Take with food, sun protection

**Recommendation**: Offer nintedanib or pirfenidone to all IPF patients (conditional recommendation, moderate-quality evidence)
- No clear superiority of one over the other
- Cannot be combined (no additional benefit, increased side effects)
- Benefits: Reduced FVC decline, reduced exacerbations, possible mortality benefit
- Do not reverse fibrosis or cure disease

**Supportive and symptomatic therapy**:

*Supplemental oxygen*:
- For resting hypoxemia (SpO₂ ≤88% or PaO₂ ≤55 mmHg)
- Ambulatory oxygen if exercise desaturation
- Improves symptoms, exercise capacity

*Pulmonary rehabilitation*:
- Exercise training, education, behavioral intervention
- Improves functional capacity, dyspnea, quality of life
- Strongly recommended

*Cough management*:
- Difficult to treat
- Trials: Thalidomide (side effects limit use), opioids (low-dose morphine), gabapentin
- No FDA-approved therapy

*Gastroesophageal reflux management*:
- Proton pump inhibitors
- Lifestyle modifications (elevate head of bed, avoid late meals)
- Role unclear (controversial)

*Vaccinations*:
- Influenza (annual), pneumococcal (PCV20 or PCV15 + PPSV23), COVID-19

*Palliative care*:
- Early integration (improves quality of life)
- Symptom management, advance care planning

**Lung transplantation**:
- Definitive treatment for eligible patients
- Indications: Progressive disease despite therapy, FVC <80% predicted or DLCO <40% predicted
- Age limit: Generally <65 years (varies by center)
- Survival: ~50-60% at 5 years post-transplant
- Refer early (evaluation takes time)

**Avoid**:
- **Corticosteroids**: Not effective, harmful in IPF (increases mortality, infections, hospitalizations)
- **Immunosuppressants**: Azathioprine + prednisone + N-acetylcysteine increased mortality (PANTHER-IPF trial)
- **N-acetylcysteine monotherapy**: No benefit
- **Anticoagulation**: Increased mortality (ACE-IPF trial)
- **Endothelin receptor antagonists**: Increased hospitalizations, no benefit

### Prognosis

**Median survival**: 3-5 years from diagnosis (range 2-10 years)

**Prognostic factors** (worse prognosis):
- Older age
- Male sex
- Lower FVC (<50% predicted)
- Lower DLCO (<40% predicted)
- Decline in FVC ≥10% over 6-12 months
- Extent of fibrosis on HRCT
- Composite physiologic index (CPI): Combines FVC, DLCO, FEV₁
- Gender-age-physiology (GAP) index: Age, sex, FVC, DLCO (predicts 1-, 2-, 3-year mortality)
- Acute exacerbation of IPF (see Complications)
- Pulmonary hypertension

**Disease course**:
- Highly variable
- Most: Slow, progressive decline
- Some: Rapid progression
- Some: Prolonged stability

### Complications

**Acute exacerbation of IPF**:
- Acute worsening of dyspnea (<1 month)
- New bilateral ground-glass opacities on HRCT (superimposed on UIP pattern)
- No evidence of infection, heart failure, PE, or other cause
- Incidence: 5-15% per year
- Mortality: 50-90%
- Treatment: Supportive care, high-dose corticosteroids (methylprednisolone 500-1000 mg IV daily × 3 days), mechanical ventilation (poor outcomes)
- Prevention: Antifibrotic therapy may reduce risk

**Pulmonary hypertension**:
- Develops in 30-50% of advanced IPF
- Worsens prognosis
- Screen: Echocardiography, consider right heart catheterization

**Lung cancer**:
- Increased risk (5-20% of IPF patients)
- Usually peripheral, adenocarcinoma
- Screen with annual low-dose CT if meets criteria

**Pneumothorax**:
- Rupture of honeycomb cysts

## Non-Specific Interstitial Pneumonia (NSIP)

### Overview

NSIP is an interstitial pneumonia characterized by varying amounts of inflammation and fibrosis with a more homogeneous, uniform pattern than UIP. It can be idiopathic or associated with connective tissue disease (most common association).

### Pathophysiology

**Subtypes**:
- **Cellular NSIP**: Predominantly inflammation (better prognosis)
- **Fibrotic NSIP**: Predominantly fibrosis (worse prognosis, but still better than IPF)

**Associations**:
- **Connective tissue disease**: Scleroderma, polymyositis/dermatomyositis, Sjögren's (most common secondary cause)
- Idiopathic (diagnosis of exclusion)
- Drug-induced
- Hypersensitivity pneumonitis

### Clinical Presentation

- Similar to IPF: Dyspnea, cough
- Younger age than IPF (40-50 years)
- Velcro crackles (less common than IPF)

### Diagnosis

**HRCT**:
- Bilateral, symmetric ground-glass opacities and/or reticular abnormality
- Subpleural sparing (relative sparing of immediate subpleural space, unlike UIP)
- Lower lobe predominance
- Traction bronchiectasis (if fibrotic)
- Minimal or absent honeycombing

**Histopathology**:
- Homogeneous, uniform pattern
- Interstitial inflammation and/or fibrosis
- Temporal uniformity (all areas at same stage, unlike UIP)
- Preservation of lung architecture (no honeycomb change)

**Workup**:
- Autoimmune serologies (rule out CTD)
- Medication/exposure history

### Treatment

**Cellular NSIP** (inflammatory):
- **Corticosteroids**: Prednisone 0.5-1 mg/kg daily × 1-3 months, then taper
- Good response expected

**Fibrotic NSIP**:
- **Corticosteroids ± immunosuppressants**: Prednisone + azathioprine or mycophenolate mofetil
- Less responsive than cellular NSIP
- Antifibrotic therapy (nintedanib, pirfenidone): Consider if progressive despite immunosuppression

**CTD-associated NSIP**:
- Treat underlying CTD
- Immunosuppression (mycophenolate, azathioprine, cyclophosphamide)

### Prognosis

**5-year survival**: 60-90% (much better than IPF)
- Cellular NSIP: Better (>90%)
- Fibrotic NSIP: Worse (60-70%)
- CTD-associated NSIP: Variable (depends on underlying disease)

## Sarcoidosis

### Overview

Sarcoidosis is a multisystem granulomatous disease of unknown etiology characterized by non-caseating granulomas, most commonly affecting the lungs and lymphatic system. It has a highly variable clinical course, ranging from asymptomatic to severe, progressive disease.

### Epidemiology

- Prevalence: 10-20 per 100,000 (Caucasians), 35-80 per 100,000 (African Americans)
- Peak incidence: 20-40 years (bimodal: second peak >50 years)
- Female > male (slightly)
- Higher incidence in Scandinavians, African Americans

### Pathophysiology

- Unknown etiology
- Abnormal immune response to unidentified antigen(s)
- CD4+ T cell-mediated response
- Formation of non-caseating granulomas
- Can resolve spontaneously or progress to fibrosis

### Clinical Presentation

**Pulmonary (>90%)**:
- Often asymptomatic (found incidentally on chest X-ray)
- Dyspnea, cough (nonproductive)
- Chest pain (rare)
- Wheezing (endobronchial granulomas)

**Extrapulmonary manifestations**:

*Lymph nodes* (most common extrapulmonary):
- Bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy (classic)
- Peripheral lymphadenopathy

*Skin* (25%):
- Erythema nodosum (tender, red nodules on shins, acute sarcoidosis, good prognosis)
- Lupus pernio (indurated plaques on nose, cheeks, ears, chronic, poor prognosis)
- Maculopapular rash, plaques, subcutaneous nodules

*Eyes* (25%):
- Uveitis (anterior, posterior, panuveitis)
- Conjunctival nodules
- Can cause blindness if untreated

*Cardiac* (5% clinically apparent, 25% autopsy):
- Arrhythmias (VT, heart block)
- Sudden cardiac death

*Hypercalcemia/hypercalciuria* (10%):
- Granulomas produce 1-α-hydroxylase (converts 25-OH vitamin D to active 1,25-OH vitamin D)

**Löfgren syndrome**:
- Acute sarcoidosis
- Triad: Bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy, erythema nodosum, arthritis (ankles)
- Excellent prognosis (>90% spontaneous remission)

**Heerfordt syndrome** (uveoparotid fever):
- Parotid gland enlargement, uveitis, facial nerve palsy, fever

### Diagnosis

**No single diagnostic test**:
- Diagnosis requires compatible clinical/radiologic picture + histologic evidence of non-caseating granulomas + exclusion of other granulomatous diseases

**Chest X-ray** (staging):
- **Stage 0**: Normal (5%)
- **Stage I**: Bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy (BHL) alone (50%)
- **Stage II**: BHL + parenchymal infiltrates (30%)
- **Stage III**: Parenchymal infiltrates alone (10-15%)
- **Stage IV**: Pulmonary fibrosis (honeycombing, traction bronchiectasis, upper lobe predominance) (5%)

**HRCT**:
- Perilymphatic nodules (along bronchovascular bundles, interlobular septa, pleura)
- Bilateral hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy
- Upper and mid-lung predominance
- Beaded appearance of bronchovascular bundles

  - Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) with transbronchial needle aspiration: High yield for lymph nodes
  - Mediastinoscopy: If bronchoscopy non-diagnostic
  - Skin, lymph node, liver biopsy: If accessible lesions
- Exclude other causes of granulomas (TB, fungi, beryllium)

**Bronchoalveolar lavage**:
- Lymphocytosis (>15%)
- Elevated CD4/CD8 ratio (>3.5) - suggestive but not diagnostic

**Pulmonary function tests**:
- May be normal (Stage I)
- Restrictive pattern: Reduced TLC, FVC (Stages II-IV)
- Reduced DLCO
- Obstruction: Rare (endobronchial disease, fibrosis)

**Cardiac evaluation** (if suspected cardiac sarcoidosis):
- ECG: Arrhythmias, conduction abnormalities
- Echocardiography: Wall motion abnormalities, reduced EF
- Cardiac MRI: Late gadolinium enhancement (patchy, mid-myocardial)

### Prognosis

**Spontaneous remission**:
- Stage I: 60-80%
- Stage II: 50-60%
- Stage III: 30%
- Stage IV: 0% (fibrosis irreversible)

**Chronic/progressive disease**: 10-30%

**Mortality**: <5% overall
- Causes: Pulmonary fibrosis/respiratory failure, cardiac sarcoidosis (sudden death, heart failure), neurologic complications

**Poor prognostic factors**:
- African American race
- Chronic, progressive disease (>2 years)
- Stage III-IV at presentation
- Lupus pernio
- Cardiac or neurologic involvement
- Chronic hypercalcemia
- Age >40 at onset

## Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis

### Overview

Hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP), also known as extrinsic allergic alveolitis, is an immune-mediated lung disease caused by inhalation of organic antigens in sensitized individuals, leading to inflammation of the alveoli and small airways.

### Etiology

**Common antigens**:
- **Bird proteins**: Pigeons, parakeets, chickens (bird fancier's lung)
- **Mold/fungi**: Thermophilic actinomycetes (farmer's lung, hot tub lung)
  - Contaminated hay, compost
  - Hot tubs, humidifiers, air conditioners
- **Mycobacterium avium complex**: Hot tubs (hot tub lung)
- **Isocyanates**: Spray paint, polyurethane foam
- **Other**: Feathers, wood dust, animal proteins

### Pathophysiology

- **Type III and Type IV hypersensitivity reactions**
- Immune complex formation (Type III): Acute phase
- T cell-mediated response (Type IV): Chronic phase
- Granuloma formation (poorly formed, non-caseating)
- Chronic exposure → fibrosis

### Clinical Presentation

**Acute HP**:
- Occurs 4-8 hours after high-level antigen exposure
- Flu-like symptoms: Fever, chills, myalgias, headache
- Dyspnea, cough (nonproductive)
- Resolves within 24-48 hours after antigen removal
- Repeated episodes with re-exposure

**Subacute HP**:
- Intermittent or continuous low-level exposure
- Gradual onset: Dyspnea, cough, fatigue, weight loss
- Symptoms improve away from exposure (weekends, vacations)

**Chronic HP** (fibrotic):
- Chronic, low-level exposure
- Progressive dyspnea, cough, weight loss
- Similar to IPF clinically
- Fibrosis may be irreversible
- **Crackles absent** (distinguishes from IPF)

### Diagnosis

**History** (critical):
- Detailed exposure history (home, work, hobbies)
- Temporal relationship between exposure and symptoms

**HRCT**:

*Acute/subacute HP*:
- Ground-glass opacities
- Poorly defined centrilobular nodules
- Mosaic attenuation (air trapping on expiratory images)
- Upper and mid-lung predominance

*Chronic fibrotic HP*:
- Reticulation, traction bronchiectasis
- Honeycombing (can mimic UIP)
- Upper and mid-lung predominance (unlike IPF)
- Mosaic attenuation, air trapping

**Laboratory**:
- **Serum precipitins** (specific IgG antibodies to suspected antigen):
  - Positive in 70-90% of exposed symptomatic patients
  - Can be positive in asymptomatic exposed individuals
  - Indicates exposure, not disease
  - Negative does not exclude HP (antigen may not be tested)

**Bronchoalveolar lavage**:
- Lymphocytosis (>20%, often >50%)
- **Decreased CD4/CD8 ratio** (<1) - characteristic
- Elevated mast cells (some cases)

**Pulmonary function tests**:
- Restrictive pattern (reduced TLC, FVC)
- Reduced DLCO
- Obstructive pattern (air trapping, small airway disease)

**Histopathology** (if biopsy performed):
- Poorly formed non-caseating granulomas (peribronchiolar)
- Chronic bronchiolitis
- Interstitial inflammation (lymphocytes, plasma cells)
- Fibrosis (chronic HP)

**Diagnostic criteria** (clinical + HRCT + exposure):
- Documented exposure to known antigen
- Positive precipitins (if available)
- Consistent HRCT findings
- BAL lymphocytosis, low CD4/CD8
- Improvement with antigen avoidance

### Treatment

**Antigen avoidance** (most important):
- Identify and eliminate antigen source
- Remove birds, remediate mold
- Improve ventilation
- Occupational change if needed
- If chronic fibrotic HP, damage may be irreversible despite avoidance

**Corticosteroids**:
- **Acute HP**: Usually self-limited, may not need treatment
  - If severe: Prednisone 0.5-1 mg/kg daily × 1-2 weeks, then taper
- **Subacute/chronic HP**: Prednisone 0.5-1 mg/kg daily × 1-3 months, then slow taper over 6-12 months
- Improves symptoms and lung function (especially if treated early)
- Less effective for chronic fibrotic HP

**Immunosuppressants**:
- Consider for chronic HP not responding to corticosteroids
- Azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil

**Antifibrotic therapy**:
- Consider nintedanib or pirfenidone for progressive fibrotic HP
- Limited evidence, extrapolated from IPF trials

**Supportive care**:
- Oxygen therapy
- Pulmonary rehabilitation

### Prognosis

**Acute HP**: Excellent with antigen avoidance (reversible)

**Subacute HP**: Good if antigen avoided and treated early

**Chronic fibrotic HP**: Poor (similar to IPF)
- Fibrosis may be irreversible
- Median survival: 3-7 years (if fibrotic)

## Complications

**All ILDs**:
- **Respiratory failure**: Progressive hypoxemia, hypercapnia
- **Pulmonary hypertension**: 30-50% of advanced ILD, worsens prognosis
- **Lung cancer**: Increased risk in fibrotic ILDs (especially IPF)
- **Pneumothorax**: Rupture of cysts/blebs
- **Infections**: Immunosuppression (treatment-related), structural lung changes

**IPF-specific**:
- **Acute exacerbation**: High mortality
- **Gastroesophageal reflux**: May worsen disease

## Key Points

- Interstitial lung diseases are a heterogeneous group of disorders affecting the lung interstitium; diagnosis requires integration of clinical, radiologic, and often pathologic findings through multidisciplinary discussion
- High-resolution CT is essential for ILD diagnosis and classification; the UIP pattern (honeycombing, basal/subpleural predominance) is characteristic of IPF
- Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is the most common idiopathic interstitial pneumonia with a median survival of 3-5 years; antifibrotic therapy (nintedanib or pirfenidone) slows disease progression but does not reverse fibrosis
- Corticosteroids are harmful in IPF but are first-line therapy for most other ILDs including NSIP, sarcoidosis, and hypersensitivity pneumonitis
- Sarcoidosis is a multisystem granulomatous disease with bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy and non-caseating granulomas; Stage I disease (BHL alone) has >60% spontaneous remission rate
- Hypersensitivity pneumonitis is an immune-mediated disease caused by inhaled organic antigens; antigen avoidance is the most important treatment, and BAL shows lymphocytosis with decreased CD4/CD8 ratio (<1)
- Pulmonary function tests in ILDs typically show restrictive pattern (reduced TLC, FVC) with reduced DLCO; DLCO is often the earliest and most sensitive abnormality
