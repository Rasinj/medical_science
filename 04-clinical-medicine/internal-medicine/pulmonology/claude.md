# Pulmonology

## Overview

Pulmonology is the medical specialty focused on the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of diseases affecting the respiratory system, including the lungs, airways, pleura, and pulmonary vasculature. Respiratory diseases represent a major global health burden, ranking among the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Pulmonologists manage a diverse spectrum of conditions, from acute infections to chronic progressive diseases and critical respiratory emergencies.

### Scope of Pulmonology
- **Obstructive lung diseases**: Asthma, COPD, bronchiectasis, cystic fibrosis
- **Infectious diseases**: Pneumonia, tuberculosis, fungal infections, viral pneumonias
- **Interstitial lung diseases**: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, sarcoidosis, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, connective tissue disease-ILD
- **Pulmonary vascular diseases**: Pulmonary embolism, pulmonary hypertension
- **Pleural diseases**: Pleural effusion, pneumothorax, pleural malignancy, empyema
- **Lung cancer**: Screening, diagnosis, staging, treatment coordination
- **Sleep-disordered breathing**: Obstructive sleep apnea, central sleep apnea, obesity hypoventilation syndrome
- **Critical care**: Acute respiratory failure, ARDS, mechanical ventilation
- **Interventional pulmonology**: Bronchoscopy, endobronchial ultrasound, pleural procedures

### Epidemiology
- Chronic respiratory diseases affect over 500 million people worldwide
- COPD is the third leading cause of death globally (3.2 million deaths annually)
- Asthma affects 262 million people worldwide
- Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death (1.8 million deaths annually)
- Pneumonia is a leading infectious cause of death, especially in children and elderly
- Pulmonary embolism: 60,000-100,000 deaths annually in the United States

### Major Risk Factors for Respiratory Disease
**Environmental exposures**:
- Tobacco smoking (most significant modifiable risk factor)
- Secondhand smoke
- Occupational exposures (asbestos, silica, coal dust)
- Air pollution (indoor and outdoor)
- Biomass fuel combustion

**Host factors**:
- Genetic predisposition (α1-antitrypsin deficiency, cystic fibrosis)
- Age (lung function declines with age)
- Recurrent respiratory infections in childhood
- Prematurity and low birth weight

**Comorbidities**:
- Immunosuppression (HIV, transplant, medications)
- Gastroesophageal reflux disease
- Obesity
- Cardiovascular disease

## Respiratory Anatomy and Physiology

### Respiratory System Structure

**Upper airways**:
- Nose and nasal cavity: Warms, humidifies, filters air
- Pharynx: Nasopharynx, oropharynx, laryngopharynx
- Larynx: Contains vocal cords, protects airway

**Lower airways**:
- **Trachea**: 10-12 cm long, C-shaped cartilage rings
- **Bronchi**: Main bronchi (right is more vertical, wider, shorter), lobar bronchi, segmental bronchi
- **Bronchioles**: Terminal bronchioles → respiratory bronchioles (no cartilage, smooth muscle)
- **Alveoli**: 300 million alveoli, total surface area ~70 m²

**Lung lobes**:
- Right lung: Three lobes (upper, middle, lower)
- Left lung: Two lobes (upper, lower) with lingula

**Pleura**:
- Visceral pleura: Covers lung surface
- Parietal pleura: Lines chest wall, diaphragm, mediastinum
- Pleural space: Contains small amount of fluid (~5-15 mL)

**Respiratory muscles**:
- Diaphragm: Primary muscle of inspiration (innervated by phrenic nerve C3-C5)
- External intercostals: Accessory inspiratory muscles
- Accessory muscles: Scalenes, sternocleidomastoid (used in respiratory distress)
- Expiratory muscles: Internal intercostals, abdominal muscles (active expiration)

### Respiratory Physiology

**Mechanics of breathing**:
- **Inspiration**: Diaphragm contracts (descends), chest wall expands → negative intrapleural pressure → air flows in
- **Expiration**: Passive recoil of lungs and chest wall (active in disease states or forced expiration)
- **Compliance**: Change in volume per unit pressure (decreased in fibrosis, increased in emphysema)
- **Resistance**: Airway caliber (increased in asthma, COPD)

**Lung volumes and capacities**:
- **Tidal volume (TV)**: Volume of normal breath (~500 mL)
- **Inspiratory reserve volume (IRV)**: Additional volume that can be inhaled (~3,000 mL)
- **Expiratory reserve volume (ERV)**: Additional volume that can be exhaled (~1,200 mL)
- **Residual volume (RV)**: Volume remaining after maximal expiration (~1,200 mL)
- **Total lung capacity (TLC)**: Total volume at maximal inspiration (TV + IRV + ERV + RV ≈ 6,000 mL)
- **Functional residual capacity (FRC)**: Volume at end of normal expiration (ERV + RV ≈ 2,400 mL)
- **Vital capacity (VC)**: Maximal volume exhaled after maximal inspiration (TV + IRV + ERV ≈ 4,800 mL)

**Gas exchange**:
- **Alveolar-capillary membrane**: 0.5 μm thick, surface area 70 m²
- **Fick's law of diffusion**: Rate of gas transfer proportional to surface area and partial pressure gradient, inversely proportional to membrane thickness
- **Oxygen cascade**: Atmospheric PO₂ (160 mmHg) → alveolar PO₂ (100 mmHg) → arterial PO₂ (95-100 mmHg) → tissue PO₂ (40 mmHg)
- **Alveolar gas equation**: PAO₂ = FiO₂(PB - PH₂O) - PaCO₂/R

**Ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) matching**:
- **Normal V/Q ratio**: ~0.8 (ventilation 4 L/min, perfusion 5 L/min)
- **V/Q mismatch**: Main cause of hypoxemia
  - Low V/Q (shunt): Perfusion exceeds ventilation (pneumonia, pulmonary edema, atelectasis)
  - High V/Q (dead space): Ventilation exceeds perfusion (pulmonary embolism)
- **Hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction**: Mechanism to match perfusion to ventilation

**Control of breathing**:
- **Central chemoreceptors** (medulla): Respond to CO₂/H⁺ in CSF (primary drive)
- **Peripheral chemoreceptors** (carotid/aortic bodies): Respond to hypoxemia, hypercapnia, acidosis
- **Mechanoreceptors**: Stretch receptors in lungs and airways

**Oxygen transport**:
- Hemoglobin saturation: 4 O₂ molecules per Hb molecule
- Oxygen content: CaO₂ = (1.34 × Hb × SaO₂) + (0.003 × PaO₂)
- Oxygen delivery: DO₂ = CaO₂ × cardiac output
- Oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve: Sigmoid shape, rightward shift (decreased affinity) with acidosis, hypercapnia, hyperthermia, increased 2,3-DPG

## Diagnostic Approaches in Pulmonology

### Clinical Assessment
