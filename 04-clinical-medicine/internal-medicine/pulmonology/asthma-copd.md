# Asthma and COPD

## Overview

Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are the two most common chronic obstructive airway diseases, affecting hundreds of millions of people worldwide. While both cause airflow limitation and respiratory symptoms, they have distinct pathophysiology, natural history, and treatment approaches. Asthma is characterized by reversible airway obstruction and hyperresponsiveness, typically beginning in childhood, while COPD is a progressive disease primarily caused by tobacco smoke exposure, usually diagnosed in middle-aged or older adults.

### Definitions

**Asthma**: A heterogeneous disease characterized by chronic airway inflammation, variable airflow obstruction, and bronchial hyperresponsiveness, manifesting as wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness, and cough.

**COPD**: A common, preventable, and treatable disease characterized by persistent respiratory symptoms and airflow limitation due to airway and/or alveolar abnormalities usually caused by significant exposure to noxious particles or gases. The chronic airflow limitation is caused by a mixture of small airway disease (obstructive bronchiolitis) and parenchymal destruction (emphysema).

### Epidemiology

**Asthma**:
- Global prevalence: 262 million people (2019)
- Affects 8-10% of adults, 5-15% of children in developed countries
- 461,000 deaths annually
- Most common chronic disease of childhood
- Increasing prevalence in developing countries

**COPD**:
- Global prevalence: 384 million people
- Third leading cause of death worldwide (3.2 million deaths annually)
- Prevalence: 10-12% in adults >40 years
- Underdiagnosed: Only 25-50% have spirometry confirmation
- Leading cause of hospitalizations in developed countries

## ASTHMA

### Pathophysiology

**Airway inflammation**:
- **Type 2 (T2) inflammation** (eosinophilic asthma, ~50%):
  - Th2 cells produce IL-4, IL-5, IL-13
  - IL-5 promotes eosinophil recruitment and survival
  - IL-4 and IL-13 drive IgE production, mucus hypersecretion
  - Responds well to inhaled corticosteroids
- **Non-T2 inflammation** (neutrophilic, paucigranulocytic):
  - Th1 and Th17 pathways
  - Neutrophil predominance
  - Less responsive to corticosteroids
  - More common in severe asthma, obesity-related asthma

**Airway remodeling**:
- Subepithelial fibrosis
- Smooth muscle hyperplasia and hypertrophy
- Mucous gland hyperplasia
- Angiogenesis
- Results in irreversible airflow limitation if severe/prolonged

**Bronchoconstriction mechanisms**:
- Mast cell degranulation → histamine, leukotrienes (immediate response)
- Smooth muscle contraction
- Airway edema and mucus plugging
- Vagal cholinergic pathways

**Triggers**:
- Allergens (dust mites, pollen, animal dander, mold)
- Viral respiratory infections (rhinovirus most common)
- Exercise (exercise-induced bronchoconstriction)
- Cold air
- Air pollution, tobacco smoke
- Occupational exposures (isocyanates, flour, wood dust)
- Medications (aspirin/NSAIDs, beta-blockers)
- Stress and emotional factors
- Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)

### Clinical Presentation

**Symptoms**:
- **Wheezing**: High-pitched whistling sounds, especially on expiration
- **Dyspnea**: Shortness of breath, often episodic
- **Chest tightness**: Constricting sensation
- **Cough**: Often dry, worse at night or early morning, or after exercise
- **Variable symptoms**: Symptoms vary over time and in intensity
- **Nocturnal symptoms**: Awakening from sleep (important marker of control)

**Pattern**:
- Episodic symptoms with symptom-free intervals
- Diurnal variation (worse at night/early morning)
- Triggered by exposure to allergens, irritants, exercise, viral infections
- Seasonal variation (allergic asthma)

**Physical examination**:
- **Between exacerbations**: Often normal
- **During exacerbation**:
  - Tachypnea, tachycardia
  - Use of accessory muscles
  - Prolonged expiratory phase
  - Wheezing (bilateral, polyphonic)
  - Hyperinflation (increased AP diameter)
  - Decreased air entry if severe
  - Pulsus paradoxus (>10 mmHg decrease in SBP during inspiration) in severe asthma

**Severity classification** (GINA):
- Based on level of treatment required to control symptoms and exacerbations
- Step 1: Mild, intermittent symptoms
- Step 2-3: Regular controller treatment needed
- Step 4-5: Moderate to severe, high treatment requirements

### Diagnosis

**Clinical diagnosis**:
- History of variable respiratory symptoms (wheeze, dyspnea, chest tightness, cough)
- Variable expiratory airflow limitation (confirmed by spirometry)

**Spirometry** (essential for diagnosis):
- **Bronchodilator reversibility test**:
  - Perform baseline spirometry
  - Administer short-acting β₂-agonist (e.g., 400 μg albuterol)
  - Repeat spirometry after 10-15 minutes
  - **Positive**: Increase in FEV₁ ≥12% AND ≥200 mL from baseline
- **Baseline spirometry**: May show obstruction (FEV₁/FVC <0.70) but can be normal between exacerbations

**Peak expiratory flow (PEF)**:
- Variability >10% suggests asthma
- Useful for monitoring at home
- Less reliable than spirometry for diagnosis

**Bronchial provocation testing**:
- **Methacholine challenge**: Diagnoses airway hyperresponsiveness
  - Positive: ≥20% fall in FEV₁ at methacholine dose ≤8 mg/mL (PC20)
  - High sensitivity, low specificity
  - Indicated when asthma suspected but spirometry normal
- **Exercise challenge**: For exercise-induced bronchoconstriction
  - Positive: ≥10% fall in FEV₁ after exercise

**Fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO)**:
- Marker of eosinophilic airway inflammation
- FeNO ≥50 ppb (adults) suggests eosinophilic inflammation
- Helps identify patients likely to respond to ICS
- Useful in diagnosis and phenotyping

**Allergy testing**:
- Skin prick tests or specific IgE blood tests
- Identifies allergic triggers
- Guides environmental control measures

**Differential diagnosis**:
- COPD (older, smoker, less reversibility)
- Vocal cord dysfunction
- Bronchiectasis
- Heart failure (cardiac asthma)
- Upper airway obstruction
- GERD with chronic cough
- Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Churg-Strauss)

### Treatment (GINA 2023 Guidelines)

**Goals**:
- Achieve good symptom control
- Maintain normal activity levels
- Minimize future risk (exacerbations, lung function decline, side effects)

**Step-wise approach** (adjust based on control):

**Step 1** (Mild, intermittent):
- **As-needed low-dose ICS-formoterol** (preferred)
  - Budesonide-formoterol 200/6 μg PRN
- Alternative: As-needed SABA alone (less preferred)

**Step 2** (Regular controller needed):
- **Daily low-dose ICS** OR **as-needed low-dose ICS-formoterol**
  - Beclomethasone 200-400 μg/day
  - Budesonide 200-400 μg/day
  - Fluticasone propionate 100-250 μg/day
- Plus as-needed SABA or ICS-formoterol

**Step 3**:
- **Low-dose ICS-LABA** (preferred)
  - Fluticasone-salmeterol 100-250/50 μg BID
  - Budesonide-formoterol 200/6 μg BID
  - Mometasone-formoterol 200/10 μg BID
- Alternative: Medium-dose ICS
- As-needed reliever: ICS-formoterol (MART approach)

**Step 4**:
- **Medium-dose ICS-LABA**
- Consider add-on therapies:
  - **LAMA** (tiotropium)
  - High-dose ICS-LABA
- Refer for specialist assessment

**Step 5** (Severe asthma):
- **High-dose ICS-LABA + LAMA**
- **Biologic therapy** (phenotype-directed):
  - **Anti-IgE** (omalizumab): Allergic asthma, elevated IgE
  - **Anti-IL-5/5R** (mepolizumab, reslizumab, benralizumab): Eosinophilic asthma (eosinophils ≥300/μL)
  - **Anti-IL-4Rα** (dupilumab): Type 2 asthma (eosinophils ≥150/μL or FeNO ≥25 ppb)
- **Oral corticosteroids** (minimize use)
- Specialist referral essential

**MART (Maintenance and Reliever Therapy)**:
- ICS-formoterol used both as daily maintenance and as-needed reliever
- Reduces exacerbations compared to fixed-dose ICS-LABA + SABA
- Budesonide-formoterol or beclomethasone-formoterol

**Leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA)**:
- **Montelukast** 10 mg daily
- Less effective than ICS
- Add-on therapy at steps 2-3
- Particularly useful in aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease, exercise-induced bronchoconstriction

**Allergen immunotherapy**:
- Subcutaneous or sublingual
- For allergic asthma with identified triggers
- Reduces symptoms and medication requirements

**Non-pharmacologic management**:
- **Smoking cessation**: Essential
- **Avoid triggers**: Allergen avoidance, occupational exposure control
- **Inhaler technique**: Review at every visit (poor technique in 70-80%)
- **Adherence**: Assess and address barriers
- **Vaccination**: Influenza (annual), pneumococcal, COVID-19
- **Weight loss**: If obese (improves control)
- **Regular physical activity**: Improves fitness, does not worsen asthma

### Asthma Exacerbations

**Severity assessment**:

*Mild-moderate exacerbation*:
- Increased symptoms, PEF >50% predicted
- Speaks in phrases, pulse <110 bpm
- No accessory muscle use
- Oxygen saturation >90%

*Severe exacerbation*:
- PEF ≤50% predicted
- Speaks in words, pulse >110 bpm
- Accessory muscle use
- Oxygen saturation <90%

*Life-threatening asthma*:
- PEF <33% predicted
- Silent chest, cyanosis
- Exhaustion, confusion, altered consciousness

*Life-threatening (ICU)*:
- All above measures
- **Continuous SABA nebulization**
- **Heliox**: Consider if available (reduces work of breathing)
- **Non-invasive ventilation**: CPAP or BiPAP (if not contraindicated)
- **Mechanical ventilation**: If respiratory failure, altered mental status
  - Low tidal volumes (6-8 mL/kg), low respiratory rate
  - Permissive hypercapnia
  - Avoid auto-PEEP (allow prolonged expiration)

**Discharge criteria** (after ED treatment):

### Monitoring and Follow-Up

**Assess asthma control** (every visit):
- **Symptom control** (past 4 weeks):
  - Daytime symptoms >2×/week?
  - Any night waking due to asthma?
  - SABA for symptoms >2×/week?
  - Any activity limitation due to asthma?
  - Well-controlled: None of above; Partly controlled: 1-2 of above; Uncontrolled: 3-4 of above
- **Future risk**:
  - Exacerbations in past year
  - Lung function (FEV₁)
  - Side effects of treatment

**Spirometry**:
- At diagnosis, 3 months after starting treatment, then periodically (at least every 1-2 years)
- Monitor lung function trends

**Review**:
- Inhaler technique
- Adherence
- Written asthma action plan
- Triggers and allergen avoidance

**Asthma action plan**:
- Personalized management plan
- Green zone (well-controlled), yellow zone (worsening), red zone (seek emergency care)
- When to increase treatment, when to seek medical care

## COPD

### Pathophysiology

**Small airway disease** (obstructive bronchiolitis):
- Airway inflammation, fibrosis, luminal plugs
- Narrowing and destruction of small airways
- Increases airway resistance

**Parenchymal destruction** (emphysema):
- Destruction of alveolar walls
- Loss of elastic recoil
- Airway collapse during expiration
- Gas trapping and hyperinflation

**Inflammatory response**:
- Neutrophils, macrophages, CD8+ T lymphocytes
- Protease-antiprotease imbalance (elastase > α₁-antitrypsin)
- Oxidative stress
- Chronic inflammation persists even after smoking cessation

**Pathologic subtypes**:
- **Emphysema**:
  - Centrilobular (smoking-related, upper lobes)
  - Panlobular (α₁-antitrypsin deficiency, lower lobes)
- **Chronic bronchitis**: Clinical diagnosis (cough and sputum production ≥3 months for ≥2 consecutive years)

**Systemic effects**:
- Skeletal muscle dysfunction, cachexia
- Cardiovascular disease (shared risk factors, systemic inflammation)
- Osteoporosis
- Depression, anxiety
- Increased risk of lung cancer

**α₁-Antitrypsin deficiency**:
- Genetic disorder (autosomal codominant, PiZZ genotype)
- Early-onset emphysema (age <45), lower lobe predominance
- Can occur in non-smokers
- Screen: Serum α₁-antitrypsin level in all COPD patients (especially young, minimal smoking, basilar emphysema)
- Augmentation therapy: IV α₁-antitrypsin infusions

### Clinical Presentation

**Symptoms**:
- **Dyspnea**: Progressive, persistent, worse with exercise (hallmark symptom)
- **Chronic cough**: May be intermittent initially, often productive
- **Sputum production**: Chronic mucus production (chronic bronchitis phenotype)
- **Wheezing and chest tightness**: Less prominent than asthma

**Modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) Dyspnea Scale**:
- Grade 0: Dyspnea only with strenuous exercise
- Grade 1: Dyspnea when hurrying on level ground or walking up slight hill
- Grade 2: Walks slower than people of same age due to dyspnea or has to stop for breath when walking at own pace
- Grade 3: Stops for breath after walking ~100 meters or after few minutes on level ground
- Grade 4: Too breathless to leave house or dyspnea with dressing/undressing

**Physical examination**:
- **Early disease**: Often normal
- **Advanced disease**:
  - **Inspection**: Barrel chest, pursed-lip breathing, accessory muscle use, tripod position
  - **Palpation**: Decreased chest expansion
  - **Percussion**: Hyperresonance, decreased diaphragmatic excursion
  - **Auscultation**: Decreased breath sounds, prolonged expiration, wheezes, crackles (if bronchitis)
  - **Cardiovascular**: Signs of cor pulmonale (elevated JVP, RV heave, peripheral edema, loud P2)
  - **Other**: Cyanosis, clubbing (rare, consider lung cancer or bronchiectasis), cachexia

**Phenotypes**:
- **Emphysema-predominant** ("pink puffer"):
  - Severe dyspnea, minimal cough
  - Thin, barrel chest
  - Low DLCO
- **Chronic bronchitis-predominant** ("blue bloater"):
  - Productive cough, less dyspnea
  - Overweight, cyanosis, edema
  - Hypercapnia common
- **Overlap syndrome (ACOS)**: Asthma-COPD overlap, features of both asthma and COPD

### Diagnosis

**Spirometry** (essential for diagnosis):
- Perform after bronchodilator administration
- **Diagnostic criteria**: Post-bronchodilator FEV₁/FVC <0.70
  - Confirms persistent airflow limitation
- **Severity** (based on FEV₁ % predicted, GOLD classification):
  - GOLD 1 (Mild): FEV₁ ≥80% predicted
  - GOLD 2 (Moderate): 50% ≤ FEV₁ <80%
  - GOLD 3 (Severe): 30% ≤ FEV₁ <50%
  - GOLD 4 (Very severe): FEV₁ <30%

**When to suspect COPD**:
- Age >40 years
- Smoking history (current or former)
- Chronic dyspnea, cough, or sputum production
- Recurrent lower respiratory tract infections
- Family history of COPD or α₁-antitrypsin deficiency

**Additional testing**:

*Chest X-ray*:
- Rule out other diagnoses
- Findings (not diagnostic): Hyperinflation, flattened diaphragm, increased retrosternal airspace, bullae

*Chest CT*:
- Quantify emphysema distribution
- Evaluate for complications (lung cancer, bronchiectasis)
- Pre-operative assessment for lung volume reduction surgery or transplant

*Pulse oximetry/ABG*:
- Assess oxygenation
- ABG if FEV₁ <40% predicted, signs of respiratory failure, or right heart failure
- Chronic hypercapnia: PaCO₂ >45 mmHg (compensated respiratory acidosis)

*α₁-Antitrypsin level*:
- Screen all patients with COPD, especially:
  - Age <45 years
  - Minimal smoking history
  - Basilar-predominant emphysema
  - Family history

*Complete blood count*:
- Polycythemia (chronic hypoxemia)
- Anemia (worsens dyspnea)

*Echocardiography*:
- Assess for pulmonary hypertension, right heart dysfunction
- If signs of cor pulmonale

**GOLD combined assessment** (guides treatment):
- Combines symptom burden, exacerbation history, airflow limitation
- **Symptom assessment**: mMRC or CAT (COPD Assessment Test)
  - mMRC ≥2 or CAT ≥10: More symptoms
- **Exacerbation history**: Number of exacerbations in past year
  - ≥2 exacerbations or ≥1 hospitalization: High risk
- **Groups**:
  - **Group A**: Few symptoms, low exacerbation risk
  - **Group B**: More symptoms, low exacerbation risk
  - **Group E**: High exacerbation risk (regardless of symptoms)

### Treatment (GOLD 2023 Guidelines)

**Goals**:
- Relieve symptoms
- Improve exercise tolerance and health status
- Prevent disease progression
- Prevent and treat exacerbations
- Reduce mortality

**Non-pharmacologic management**:

*Smoking cessation*:
- **Single most important intervention** to slow disease progression
- All patients should be counseled at every visit
- Pharmacotherapy:
  - Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT): Patch, gum, lozenge
  - Varenicline: Partial nicotine receptor agonist
  - Bupropion: Antidepressant, reduces cravings
- Combination therapy (NRT + varenicline or bupropion) most effective
- Behavioral counseling

*Pulmonary rehabilitation*:
- **Comprehensive intervention**: Exercise training, education, behavioral modification
- Improves dyspnea, exercise capacity, quality of life
- Reduces hospitalizations
- Indicated for all symptomatic patients (especially mMRC ≥2)
- Benefits maintained with continued exercise

*Vaccinations*:
- **Influenza vaccine**: Annual (reduces exacerbations)
- **Pneumococcal vaccine**: PCV20 (single dose) OR PCV15 + PPSV23
- **COVID-19 vaccine**: Recommended
- **Tdap**: If not previously vaccinated

*Oxygen therapy*:
- **Long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT)**:
  - Indications:
    - PaO₂ ≤55 mmHg or SpO₂ ≤88% at rest
    - PaO₂ 56-59 mmHg or SpO₂ 89% with cor pulmonale or polycythemia (Hct >55%)
  - Prescription: ≥15 hours/day (ideally 24 hours)
  - Improves survival, reduces hospitalizations
  - Reassess after 60-90 days (may improve with treatment)
- **Ambulatory oxygen**: If exercise desaturation (SpO₂ <88%)

*Nutrition*:
- Maintain healthy weight
- Underweight: Nutritional supplementation (associated with worse outcomes)
- Overweight/obese: Weight loss improves dyspnea

**Pharmacologic management** (inhaled therapies):

*Bronchodilators*:

**Long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMAs)** (preferred first-line):
- Tiotropium 18 μg daily (HandiHaler) or 5 μg daily (Respimat)
- Umeclidinium 62.5 μg daily
- Aclidinium 400 μg BID
- Glycopyrrolate 15.6 μg BID

**Long-acting β₂-agonists (LABAs)**:
- Salmeterol 50 μg BID
- Formoterol 12 μg BID
- Indacaterol 75 μg daily
- Vilanterol 25 μg daily
- Olodaterol 5 μg daily

**Short-acting bronchodilators** (rescue):
- **SABAs**: Albuterol, levalbuterol
- **SAMAs**: Ipratropium
- Used as needed for symptom relief

*Combination therapy* (superior to monotherapy):
- **LAMA + LABA** (preferred for Group B and E):
  - Umeclidinium/vilanterol 62.5/25 μg daily
  - Tiotropium/olodaterol 5/5 μg daily
  - Glycopyrrolate/formoterol 18/9.6 μg BID
  - Aclidinium/formoterol 400/12 μg BID

*Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS)*:
- **Indications** (add to LABA or LAMA/LABA):
  - History of exacerbations despite LAMA or LAMA/LABA
  - Blood eosinophils ≥300 cells/μL
  - Overlap with asthma features
- **Not first-line monotherapy for COPD** (less effective than LAMA, increased pneumonia risk)
- **Triple therapy** (ICS/LAMA/LABA):
  - Fluticasone furoate/umeclidinium/vilanterol 100/62.5/25 μg daily
  - Budesonide/glycopyrrolate/formoterol 320/18/9.6 μg BID
  - Beclomethasone/glycopyrrolate/formoterol 200/12.5/6 μg BID
  - Indicated for frequent exacerbations or eosinophils ≥300

*Other medications*:
- **Roflumilast**: PDE-4 inhibitor, 500 μg daily
  - For severe COPD (FEV₁ <50%) with chronic bronchitis and exacerbations despite LAMA/LABA or triple therapy
  - Reduces exacerbations
  - Side effects: Diarrhea, nausea, weight loss
- **Azithromycin**: 250 mg daily or 500 mg 3×/week
  - For frequent exacerbations despite optimal inhaler therapy
  - Anti-inflammatory effects
  - Monitor: Hearing, QTc, drug interactions

**Treatment algorithm**:

*Initial treatment*:
- **Group A** (few symptoms, low risk): LAMA or LABA
- **Group B** (more symptoms, low risk): LAMA or LAMA + LABA
- **Group E** (high exacerbation risk): LAMA + LABA (eosinophils <300) OR ICS + LABA + LAMA (eosinophils ≥300)

*Follow-up*:
- Assess response (symptoms, exacerbations)
- **If inadequate control**:
  - Escalate therapy (add LABA to LAMA, add ICS to LAMA/LABA)
  - Consider roflumilast, azithromycin
  - Review inhaler technique, adherence
  - Treat comorbidities

*De-escalation*:
- Consider withdrawing ICS if no exacerbations and low eosinophils
- Replace with LAMA/LABA

**Surgical/interventional options**:

*Bullectomy*:
- For large bullae causing compression

*Lung volume reduction surgery (LVRS)*:
- For severe upper lobe emphysema, low exercise capacity
- Improves survival in select patients
- NETT trial: Benefit if upper lobe emphysema + low exercise capacity

*Bronchoscopic lung volume reduction*:
- **Endobronchial valves**: One-way valves block airflow to emphysematous lobes
- For heterogeneous emphysema with intact fissure
- Less invasive than surgery

*Lung transplantation*:
- For very severe COPD (FEV₁ <25%, BODE index ≥7)
- Improves quality of life, functional capacity (survival benefit uncertain)

### COPD Exacerbations

**Definition**: Acute worsening of respiratory symptoms (dyspnea, cough, sputum) beyond normal day-to-day variation, requiring change in medication.

**Severity**:
- **Mild**: Increased SABA use only
- **Moderate**: SABA + antibiotics and/or oral corticosteroids
- **Severe**: Hospitalization or ED visit

**Triggers**:
- Respiratory infections (viral or bacterial): 70-80%
- Air pollution, environmental exposures
- Non-adherence to medications
- Unknown: 30%

**Assessment**:
- Severity of symptoms (dyspnea, sputum volume/purulence, cough)
- Vital signs (tachypnea, tachycardia, fever, oxygen saturation)
- Comorbidities (heart failure, CAD, diabetes)
- Previous exacerbations, hospitalizations
- Chest X-ray (rule out pneumonia, pneumothorax, CHF)
- ABG if severe (assess hypoxemia, hypercapnia, acidosis)

**Treatment** (outpatient, mild-moderate):
- **Increase SABA**: Every 4-6 hours or as needed
- **Systemic corticosteroids**: Prednisone 40 mg daily × 5 days
- **Antibiotics** (if ≥2 cardinal symptoms: increased dyspnea, increased sputum volume, increased sputum purulence):
  - Amoxicillin-clavulanate 875/125 mg BID × 5-7 days
  - Azithromycin 500 mg daily × 3-5 days
  - Doxycycline 100 mg BID × 5-7 days
  - Respiratory fluoroquinolone (levofloxacin, moxifloxacin) if risk factors for Pseudomonas
- Ensure on appropriate long-term therapy (LAMA/LABA)

**Treatment** (hospitalization, severe):
- **Oxygen**: Target SpO₂ 88-92% (avoid over-oxygenation, risk of CO₂ retention)
- **Bronchodilators**:
  - Nebulized SABA (albuterol 2.5-5 mg every 4-6 hours or continuous)
  - Nebulized SAMA (ipratropium 500 μg every 6-8 hours) - add to SABA
- **Systemic corticosteroids**:
  - Prednisone 40 mg PO daily OR methylprednisolone 40-125 mg IV every 6-8 hours
  - Duration: 5 days (as effective as 14 days with fewer side effects)
- **Antibiotics**: As above (always if purulent sputum)
- **Non-invasive ventilation (NIV)**:
  - Indications: Respiratory acidosis (pH <7.35, PaCO₂ >45 mmHg), severe dyspnea, respiratory distress
  - Reduces intubation rate, mortality, hospital stay
  - Contraindications: Hemodynamic instability, altered mental status, facial trauma/surgery
- **Invasive mechanical ventilation**:
  - If NIV failure or contraindicated
  - Severe acidosis (pH <7.25), hypoxemia despite oxygen
  - Avoid high tidal volumes (6-8 mL/kg IBW)
  - Permissive hypercapnia
  - Allow prolonged expiration (avoid auto-PEEP)
- **Monitor**: ABG, electrolytes, fluid balance

**Discharge criteria**:
- SABA use ≤every 4 hours
- Able to walk
- Able to eat and sleep without dyspnea
- Clinically stable ×12-24 hours
- ABG stable
- Ensure discharge medications, inhaler technique reviewed
- Follow-up within 4 weeks

**Prevention of exacerbations**:
- Smoking cessation
- Vaccinations
- Optimal maintenance therapy (LAMA/LABA, ICS if indicated)
- Pulmonary rehabilitation
- Long-term azithromycin or roflumilast if frequent exacerbations

## Complications

### Asthma
- **Acute respiratory failure**: Life-threatening exacerbation, requiring mechanical ventilation
- **Atelectasis**: Mucus plugging
- **Pneumothorax/pneumomediastinum**: Barotrauma (rare)
- **Medication side effects**:
  - ICS: Oral candidiasis, dysphonia, increased risk of pneumonia (COPD), cataracts, osteoporosis (high dose)
  - LABA: Tachycardia, tremor, hypokalemia (should not be used without ICS in asthma)
  - Systemic corticosteroids: Hyperglycemia, hypertension, osteoporosis, immunosuppression, psychiatric effects

### COPD
- **Acute exacerbations**: Leads to accelerated lung function decline, hospitalizations
- **Respiratory failure**: Hypoxemic and/or hypercapnic
- **Cor pulmonale**: Right heart failure due to pulmonary hypertension
- **Polycythemia**: Secondary to chronic hypoxemia
- **Pneumothorax**: Rupture of bullae
- **Lung cancer**: 4-6 times higher risk in COPD patients
- **Osteoporosis**: Chronic inflammation, corticosteroid use
- **Depression and anxiety**: Common, worsens quality of life
- **Cachexia**: Muscle wasting, poor prognosis

## Prognosis

### Asthma
- **With appropriate treatment**: Excellent prognosis, most patients well-controlled
- **Poorly controlled asthma**: Increased exacerbations, hospitalization, lung function decline
- **Severe asthma**: 5-10% of patients, refractory to standard therapy, high disease burden
- **Mortality**: 461,000 deaths globally per year (mostly preventable)
- **Poor prognostic factors**: Frequent exacerbations, hospitalizations, ICU admission, intubation

### COPD
- **BODE index** (Body mass index, Obstruction, Dyspnea, Exercise capacity):
  - Predicts mortality better than FEV₁ alone
  - Scores 0-10 (higher worse): FEV₁, 6-minute walk distance, mMRC dyspnea, BMI
- **Median survival**:
  - GOLD 1-2: >10 years
  - GOLD 3: 5-7 years
  - GOLD 4: 2-3 years
- **Prognostic factors**:
  - FEV₁ (most important spirometric predictor)
  - Exacerbation frequency
  - Dyspnea severity
  - Exercise capacity
  - Comorbidities (cardiovascular disease most common cause of death)
  - Hypoxemia, hypercapnia
  - Pulmonary hypertension

## Key Points

- Asthma is characterized by reversible airflow obstruction and airway hyperresponsiveness; diagnosis requires demonstration of variable expiratory airflow limitation on spirometry (≥12% and ≥200 mL increase in FEV₁ after bronchodilator)
- GINA guidelines recommend inhaled corticosteroid-containing therapy for all asthma patients, even mild intermittent asthma (as-needed low-dose ICS-formoterol preferred over SABA alone)
- COPD is diagnosed by post-bronchodilator FEV₁/FVC <0.70 on spirometry in patients with risk factors (primarily smoking)
- Smoking cessation is the single most effective intervention to slow COPD progression and reduce mortality
- Long-acting bronchodilators (LAMA and/or LABA) are first-line maintenance therapy for COPD; inhaled corticosteroids should be added for patients with frequent exacerbations or elevated eosinophils (≥300 cells/μL)
- COPD exacerbations should be treated with increased bronchodilators, systemic corticosteroids (prednisone 40 mg × 5 days), and antibiotics if signs of bacterial infection (increased sputum purulence)
- Long-term oxygen therapy (≥15 hours/day) improves survival in COPD patients with chronic hypoxemia (PaO₂ ≤55 mmHg or SpO₂ ≤88%)
- Non-invasive ventilation reduces mortality and intubation rates in COPD exacerbations with respiratory acidosis (pH <7.35)
