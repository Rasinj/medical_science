# Pulmonary Embolism

## Overview

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is the obstruction of one or more pulmonary arteries by thromboemboli, most commonly originating from deep veins of the lower extremities. PE is part of the spectrum of venous thromboembolism (VTE), which also includes deep vein thrombosis (DVT). PE is a major cause of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, with significant diagnostic challenges due to nonspecific clinical presentations. Early recognition, risk stratification, and appropriate anticoagulation are critical for improving outcomes.

### Epidemiology

**Incidence**:
- VTE: 1-2 per 1,000 population annually
- PE: ~600,000 cases annually in United States
- Third most common acute cardiovascular syndrome (after MI and stroke)

**Mortality**:
- Untreated PE: 25-30% mortality
- Treated PE: 2-8% mortality
- 60,000-100,000 deaths annually in United States
- Leading preventable cause of hospital death

**Risk increases with age**:
- Rare in children
- Incidence doubles each decade after age 60
- Median age: 62 years

### Pathophysiology

**Virchow's triad** (predisposing factors for thrombosis):
1. **Venous stasis**: Immobility, paralysis, varicose veins
2. **Endothelial injury**: Trauma, surgery, central venous catheters
3. **Hypercoagulability**: Inherited or acquired thrombophilias

**Source of emboli**:
- **Deep vein thrombosis (DVT)**: 90% (proximal leg veins: femoral, popliteal, iliac)
- Upper extremity DVT: 10% (subclavian, axillary veins; often catheter-associated)
- Right heart thrombi: Rare
- Paradoxical embolism: Through patent foramen ovale (PFO) from venous system

**Consequences of PE**:
- **Hemodynamic effects**:
  - Increased pulmonary vascular resistance (mechanical obstruction + vasoconstriction from platelet mediators)
  - Increased right ventricular afterload
  - RV strain, dilation, dysfunction
  - Decreased cardiac output
  - Systemic hypotension (if massive PE)
  - RV ischemia (increased demand, decreased coronary perfusion)
- **Respiratory effects**:
  - Increased alveolar dead space (ventilation without perfusion)
  - Hypoxemia (V/Q mismatch, shunt, low cardiac output)
  - Hyperventilation (hypoxia, anxiety)
  - Bronchoconstriction
- **Inflammatory response**: Cytokines, inflammatory mediators

**Outcomes**:
- **Resolution**: Most emboli resolve with anticoagulation (endogenous fibrinolysis)
- **Recurrent PE**: 5-10% risk within 3 months if untreated
- **Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH)**: 2-4% (persistent obstruction, pulmonary vascular remodeling)

### Risk Factors

**Strong risk factors** (OR >10):
- **Lower extremity fracture**: Hip or leg
- **Hip or knee replacement surgery**
- **Major general surgery**
- **Major trauma**
- **Spinal cord injury**

**Moderate risk factors** (OR 2-9):
- **Arthroscopic knee surgery**
- **Central venous catheter**
- **Chemotherapy**
- **Congestive heart failure or respiratory failure**
- **Hormone replacement therapy**
- **Malignancy** (especially active, metastatic, pancreatic, lung, hematologic)
- **Oral contraceptives**
- **Pregnancy and postpartum period**
- **Prior VTE**
- **Stroke**
- **Thrombophilia** (inherited or acquired):
  - Factor V Leiden (most common inherited, 3-8x risk)
  - Prothrombin G20210A mutation
  - Protein C, protein S, antithrombin deficiency
  - Antiphospholipid syndrome
  - Hyperhomocysteinemia

**Weak risk factors** (OR <2):
- **Prolonged immobility** (>3 days bedrest, long-distance travel >4-6 hours)
- **Obesity** (BMI ≥30 kg/m²)
- **Advanced age** (>60 years)
- **Laparoscopic surgery** (e.g., cholecystectomy)
- **Pregnancy**
- **Varicose veins**

**Provoked vs. unprovoked VTE**:
- **Provoked**: Identifiable transient risk factor (surgery, trauma, immobilization, pregnancy)
  - Lower recurrence risk after anticoagulation stopped
- **Unprovoked**: No identifiable trigger
  - Higher recurrence risk (10% per year off anticoagulation)
  - May warrant extended anticoagulation

## Clinical Presentation

**Symptoms** (nonspecific, highly variable):
- **Dyspnea**: Most common (80%), sudden or gradual onset, at rest or exertional
- **Pleuritic chest pain**: Sharp, worse with breathing (40-50%), suggests peripheral PE with pleural involvement (pulmonary infarction)
- **Cough**: 20-30%, may be productive, hemoptysis if infarction
- **Hemoptysis**: 10-15%, usually small volume
- **Syncope or presyncope**: Massive PE with hemodynamic compromise
- **Leg pain or swelling**: DVT symptoms (30%)
- **Anxiety, apprehension**

**Physical examination findings**:
- **Tachypnea**: Most common sign (respiratory rate >20/min, 70%)
- **Tachycardia**: 30-40%
- **Fever**: Low-grade (<38.5°C)
- **Hypoxemia**: Decreased oxygen saturation (SpO₂ <95%)
- **Hypotension**: Massive PE with shock
- **Signs of DVT**: Unilateral leg swelling, warmth, erythema, tenderness, Homan's sign (unreliable)
- **Signs of RV strain** (severe PE):
  - Elevated jugular venous pressure
  - RV heave, loud P2 (pulmonary component of S2)
  - Tricuspid regurgitation murmur
  - Hepatomegaly, peripheral edema
- **Pleural friction rub**: Pulmonary infarction
- **Cyanosis**: Severe hypoxemia

**Classic presentations**:
- **Pulmonary infarction**: Pleuritic chest pain, hemoptysis, fever, pleural effusion (peripheral PE)
- **Acute cor pulmonale**: Dyspnea, hypotension, RV strain (massive central PE)
- **Unexplained dyspnea**: Isolated dyspnea without other findings (submassive PE)

**Massive PE**:
- Sustained hypotension (SBP <90 mmHg for >15 minutes or requiring vasopressors)
- Cardiogenic shock
- Cardiac arrest
- High mortality (>15%)

**Submassive (intermediate-risk) PE**:
- Hemodynamically stable
- Evidence of RV dysfunction (echocardiography, CT) OR myocardial injury (elevated troponin)
- Mortality: 3-15%

**Low-risk PE**:
- Hemodynamically stable
- No RV dysfunction or myocardial injury
- Mortality: <1%

## Diagnosis

### Clinical Probability Assessment

**Wells Score for Pulmonary Embolism**:

| Clinical Feature | Points |
|-----------------|--------|
| Clinical signs/symptoms of DVT | 3 |
| PE as likely or more likely than alternative diagnosis | 3 |
| Heart rate >100 bpm | 1.5 |
| Immobilization (≥3 days) or surgery within 4 weeks | 1.5 |
| Prior PE or DVT | 1.5 |
| Hemoptysis | 1 |
| Malignancy (active treatment within 6 months or palliative) | 1 |

**Interpretation**:
- **Low probability**: <2 points (PE prevalence ~10%)
- **Moderate probability**: 2-6 points (PE prevalence ~30%)
- **High probability**: >6 points (PE prevalence ~65%)

**Alternative (simplified) Wells Score**:
- **PE unlikely**: ≤4 points
- **PE likely**: >4 points

**Revised Geneva Score**: Alternative clinical decision tool (similar performance to Wells score)

**Clinical gestalt**:
- Experienced clinicians can estimate pretest probability without formal scoring
- Important to avoid over-testing (low pretest probability + negative D-dimer = PE excluded)

### D-Dimer

**Characteristics**:
- Fibrin degradation product (elevated in thrombosis)
- **High sensitivity** (95-98%), **low specificity** (50%)
- Useful for **ruling out** PE in low-risk patients
- Not useful for ruling in PE (many false positives)

**Thresholds**:
- Standard cutoff: <500 ng/mL (negative)
- **Age-adjusted D-dimer** (age >50): Cutoff = age × 10 ng/mL
  - Increases specificity without sacrificing sensitivity
  - Example: 70-year-old patient, cutoff = 700 ng/mL

**Interpretation**:
- **Low clinical probability + negative D-dimer**: PE excluded, no further testing
- **Moderate-high clinical probability**: Proceed to imaging regardless of D-dimer
- **Elevated D-dimer**: Nonspecific, requires imaging

**False positives** (elevated D-dimer without VTE):
- Pregnancy
- Recent surgery or trauma
- Malignancy
- Infection, sepsis
- Liver disease
- Acute coronary syndrome, stroke
- Advanced age
- Hospitalization

### Imaging Studies

**CT Pulmonary Angiography (CTPA)**:
- **Gold standard** for PE diagnosis
- Sensitivity: 83-90%, Specificity: 95%
- IV contrast required
- Direct visualization of thrombus in pulmonary arteries
- **Positive findings**:
  - Filling defect partially or completely occluding artery
  - Intraluminal thrombus outlined by contrast
- **Advantages**:
  - Rapid, widely available
  - Visualizes parenchyma (alternative diagnoses: pneumonia, pleural effusion, malignancy)
  - Assesses RV size (RV/LV ratio >1 indicates RV strain)
- **Limitations**:
  - Radiation exposure
  - IV contrast (nephrotoxic, contraindicated in renal insufficiency or contrast allergy)
  - May miss small subsegmental PE
  - Respiratory/cardiac motion artifact

**Ventilation-Perfusion (V/Q) Scan**:
- **Alternative to CTPA** if contraindication to contrast (renal insufficiency, contrast allergy, pregnancy)
- Technetium-99m perfusion + xenon or technetium-labeled aerosol ventilation
- **PISAPED criteria** (Prospective Investigation of Pulmonary Embolism Diagnosis):
  - **PE present**: Wedge-shaped perfusion defect with normal ventilation (V/Q mismatch)
  - **PE absent**: Normal perfusion, matched defects, non-wedge-shaped defects
- **Interpretation** (older criteria):
  - **Normal**: PE excluded
  - **Low probability**: <20% likelihood
  - **Intermediate probability**: 20-80% likelihood (non-diagnostic, further testing needed)
  - **High probability**: >80% likelihood (treat as PE)
- **Limitations**:
  - Many intermediate probability scans (20-30%)
  - Less useful if underlying lung disease (COPD, pneumonia)

**Compression Ultrasonography (Lower Extremity Doppler)**:
- Detects DVT (surrogate for PE)
- **Positive DVT**: Treat as VTE (same anticoagulation as PE)
- **Sensitivity** for proximal DVT: 95%
- **Limitations**:
  - Only 30% of PE patients have detectable DVT
  - Negative result does not exclude PE
  - Useful if CTPA contraindicated and high clinical suspicion

**Echocardiography**:
- Not for diagnosing PE (cannot visualize pulmonary arteries)
- **Assesses RV function and hemodynamic consequences**:
  - RV dilation (RV/LV ratio >0.9 or >1)
  - RV hypokinesis
  - Tricuspid regurgitation
  - Pulmonary hypertension (elevated PA pressure)
  - McConnell sign: RV free wall hypokinesis with apical sparing (specific for PE)
  - Thrombus in transit (right atrium/ventricle)
- **Indications**:
  - Hemodynamically unstable patients (bedside assessment)
  - Risk stratification (submassive PE)

**Pulmonary Angiography**:
- Invasive, catheter-based
- Rarely used (CTPA has replaced it)
- Reserved for catheter-directed interventions (thrombolysis, thrombectomy)

### Other Diagnostic Tests

**Arterial blood gas**:
- Often shows hypoxemia, hypocapnia (respiratory alkalosis from hyperventilation)
- Increased A-a gradient
- **Normal ABG does not exclude PE** (25% of PE patients have normal PaO₂)

**Electrocardiogram (ECG)**:
- **Sinus tachycardia**: Most common (30%)
- **Nonspecific ST-T wave changes**
- **Signs of RV strain** (severe PE):
  - S1Q3T3 pattern: Deep S wave in lead I, Q wave and inverted T wave in lead III (classic but uncommon, 20%)
  - Right bundle branch block (RBBB, new or incomplete)
  - Right axis deviation
  - T wave inversions in anterior precordial leads (V1-V4)
- **Normal ECG**: Does not exclude PE

**Chest X-ray**:
- Often **normal** (12-50%)
- **Nonspecific findings**:
  - Atelectasis
  - Pleural effusion (usually small, unilateral)
  - Elevated hemidiaphragm
- **Classic findings** (rare):
  - Westermark sign: Oligemia (decreased vascular markings) distal to embolus
  - Hampton hump: Peripheral wedge-shaped opacity (pulmonary infarction)
  - Fleischner sign: Enlarged pulmonary artery
- **Purpose**: Exclude other diagnoses (pneumonia, pneumothorax, rib fracture)

**Biomarkers** (for risk stratification, not diagnosis):
- **Troponin** (cTnI or cTnT):
  - Elevated in RV strain/ischemia (30-50% of PE)
  - Associated with worse prognosis
- **BNP or NT-proBNP**:
  - Elevated in RV strain
  - Prognostic value

### Diagnostic Algorithm

**Step 1: Assess clinical probability** (Wells score or clinical gestalt)

**Step 2: Low or intermediate probability**:
- **D-dimer**:
  - Negative → PE excluded, no further testing
  - Positive → CTPA

**Step 3: High probability**:
- **CTPA** (skip D-dimer)
- If contraindication to CTPA → V/Q scan or lower extremity ultrasound

**Step 4: CTPA result**:
- **Positive**: Treat for PE
- **Negative**: PE excluded (if good-quality study)
- **Non-diagnostic** (subsegmental PE, poor-quality study): Consider lower extremity ultrasound or repeat imaging

**Pregnancy**:
- Start with compression ultrasound (if positive, treat)
- If negative, V/Q scan preferred over CTPA (lower radiation to breast tissue)

**Hemodynamically unstable patients** (suspected massive PE):
- **Bedside echocardiography**: RV strain suggests PE
- **CTPA if stable enough** for transport to radiology
- **Empiric anticoagulation or thrombolysis** if cannot be stabilized for imaging

## Treatment

### Anticoagulation

**Goals**:
- Prevent thrombus extension
- Prevent recurrent VTE
- Allow endogenous fibrinolysis
- Reduce mortality

**Initial anticoagulation** (first 5-10 days):

*Parenteral anticoagulants*:
- **Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH)** (preferred):
  - **Enoxaparin**: 1 mg/kg SC every 12 hours OR 1.5 mg/kg SC daily
  - **Dalteparin**: 200 IU/kg SC daily
  - Advantages: Predictable, no monitoring, outpatient use
  - Contraindications: Severe renal impairment (CrCl <30 mL/min), high bleeding risk
- **Unfractionated heparin (UFH)**:
  - Bolus: 80 units/kg IV (or 5,000 units), then infusion: 18 units/kg/hr
  - Adjust based on aPTT (target 1.5-2.5× control)
  - Indications: Severe renal impairment, high bleeding risk (short half-life, reversible), massive PE (considering thrombolysis)
- **Fondaparinux**:
  - Synthetic factor Xa inhibitor
  - Weight-based dosing: <50 kg: 5 mg SC daily; 50-100 kg: 7.5 mg SC daily; >100 kg: 10 mg SC daily
  - Alternative to LMWH/UFH

*Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs)* (can be used as monotherapy, no need for parenteral lead-in):
- **Apixaban**: 10 mg PO BID × 7 days, then 5 mg PO BID
- **Rivaroxaban**: 15 mg PO BID × 21 days, then 20 mg PO daily
- **Dabigatran**: Start with parenteral anticoagulant × 5-10 days, then dabigatran 150 mg PO BID
- **Edoxaban**: Start with parenteral anticoagulant × 5-10 days, then edoxaban 60 mg PO daily

**Long-term anticoagulation** (after initial 5-10 days):

*Warfarin*:
- Start with parenteral anticoagulant (overlap × 5 days until INR therapeutic)
- Target INR: 2-3
- Monitor INR frequently (weekly initially, then monthly when stable)
- Disadvantages: Narrow therapeutic window, drug/food interactions, requires monitoring

*Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs)* (preferred over warfarin):
- **Apixaban**: 5 mg PO BID (or 2.5 mg BID if ≥2 of: age ≥80, weight ≤60 kg, Cr ≥1.5)
- **Rivaroxaban**: 20 mg PO daily with food (15 mg if CrCl 30-49 mL/min)
- **Edoxaban**: 60 mg PO daily (30 mg if weight ≤60 kg, CrCl 30-50 mL/min, or certain P-gp inhibitors)
- **Dabigatran**: 150 mg PO BID (110 mg BID if age ≥80 or high bleeding risk)
- **Advantages**: Fixed dosing, no monitoring, fewer drug interactions, lower ICH risk
- **Disadvantages**: Cost, require adherence (short half-life), limited reversal agents
- **Contraindications**: Severe renal impairment (CrCl <30 mL/min for most), mechanical heart valves, antiphospholipid syndrome

**Duration of anticoagulation**:

*Provoked PE* (transient risk factor, e.g., surgery, trauma):
- **3 months** (sufficient for most cases)

*Unprovoked PE* (no identifiable risk factor):
- **At least 3 months**, then reassess
- **Extended anticoagulation** (indefinite): Consider if:
  - Low bleeding risk
  - Patient preference
  - Good adherence
  - Recurrence risk >5% per year off anticoagulation
- Balance: Recurrence risk (10% per year unprovoked PE) vs. bleeding risk (1-3% per year major bleeding on anticoagulation)

*Cancer-associated PE*:
- **LMWH** preferred over warfarin or DOACs (first 6 months)
  - Enoxaparin 1 mg/kg SC every 12 hours OR 1.5 mg/kg daily
  - Reduced dose after 6 months (e.g., 75% of therapeutic dose)
- **DOACs**: Alternative (apixaban, rivaroxaban, edoxaban studied in cancer-VTE)
- **Duration**: Continue anticoagulation as long as cancer active or on treatment

*Recurrent PE*:
- Extended anticoagulation (indefinite)

**Inferior vena cava (IVC) filter**:
- **Indications**:
  - Absolute contraindication to anticoagulation (active bleeding)
  - Recurrent PE despite therapeutic anticoagulation
  - Massive PE with cardiopulmonary compromise (adjunct to thrombolysis)
- **Types**: Retrievable (preferred, remove when safe to anticoagulate) or permanent
- **Complications**: Thrombosis, filter migration, IVC occlusion, filter fracture
- **Not a substitute for anticoagulation**: Start anticoagulation when bleeding risk resolves

### Thrombolysis (Fibrinolytic Therapy)

**Indications**:
- **Massive PE** (high-risk):
  - Hemodynamic instability (hypotension, shock, cardiac arrest)
  - Mortality benefit demonstrated
- **Submassive PE** (intermediate-risk):
  - Controversial (case-by-case decision)
  - RV dysfunction + hemodynamic compensation but at risk for decompensation
  - Younger patients, low bleeding risk, severe hypoxemia
  - Reduces hemodynamic decompensation but increases major bleeding (especially ICH)
  - No mortality benefit in trials (PEITHO trial)

**Contraindications**:
- **Absolute**:
  - Active bleeding
  - Recent intracranial/intraspinal surgery (<2 months)
  - Intracranial neoplasm, AVM, aneurysm
  - History of hemorrhagic stroke
  - Ischemic stroke <3 months
- **Relative**:
  - Uncontrolled hypertension (SBP >180 mmHg)
  - Recent major surgery (<10 days)
  - Recent GI bleeding
  - Bleeding diathesis
  - Pregnancy
  - Diabetic hemorrhagic retinopathy

**Regimens**:
- **Alteplase (tPA)**: 100 mg IV over 2 hours (most commonly used)
  - Alternative: Accelerated regimen: 0.6 mg/kg IV over 15 minutes (max 50 mg)
- **Streptokinase**: 250,000 units IV over 30 minutes, then 100,000 units/hr × 12-24 hours
- **Urokinase**: 4,400 units/kg IV over 10 minutes, then 4,400 units/kg/hr × 12-24 hours

**Monitoring**:
- Avoid invasive procedures, IM injections
- Hold anticoagulation during infusion
- Resume anticoagulation after thrombolysis (no bolus)

**Outcomes**:
- Rapid improvement in hemodynamics, RV function (within hours)
- Reduces mortality in massive PE (absolute risk reduction ~10%)
- Increases major bleeding risk (10-20%, ICH 1-3%)

### Catheter-Directed Therapy

**Catheter-directed thrombolysis**:
- Local delivery of thrombolytic agent via catheter in pulmonary artery
- Lower dose than systemic thrombolysis (reduced bleeding risk)
- Indications: Massive or submassive PE, contraindication to systemic thrombolysis

**Catheter-directed thrombectomy**:
- Mechanical removal of thrombus (suction, fragmentation)
- Indications: Massive PE with contraindication to thrombolysis

**Embolectomy**:
- Surgical removal of thrombus (open or percutaneous)
- Reserved for massive PE when thrombolysis failed or contraindicated

### Supportive Care

**Oxygen**:
- Supplemental oxygen for hypoxemia (target SpO₂ >90%)

**Fluids**:
- IV fluids cautiously for hypotension
- Avoid aggressive fluid resuscitation (worsens RV distension and dysfunction)

**Vasopressors**:
- Norepinephrine for refractory hypotension
- Avoid pure vasodilators (worsen hypotension)

**Mechanical ventilation**:
- Avoid if possible (positive pressure worsens RV function)
- If needed: Low tidal volumes, minimize PEEP, permissive hypercapnia

**Veno-arterial ECMO**:
- Bridge to recovery or definitive therapy in refractory shock
- Case reports, limited data

## Complications

**Recurrent VTE**:
- 5-10% within 3 months if untreated
- 10% per year after stopping anticoagulation (unprovoked PE)
- Lower risk with provoked PE (1-2% per year)

**Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH)**:
- Persistent pulmonary vascular obstruction and remodeling
- Develops in 2-4% of PE patients
- Symptoms: Progressive dyspnea, exercise intolerance
- Diagnosis: V/Q scan (mismatched defects), right heart catheterization (elevated mean PA pressure ≥25 mmHg), pulmonary angiography
- Treatment: Pulmonary thromboendarterectomy (PTE) surgery (potentially curative), balloon pulmonary angioplasty, pulmonary vasodilators (riociguat)

**Bleeding complications** (anticoagulation):
- Major bleeding: 1-3% per year
- Intracranial hemorrhage: 0.5-1% per year (warfarin), lower with DOACs
- Reversal agents:
  - Warfarin: Vitamin K, fresh frozen plasma (FFP), prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC)
  - Dabigatran: Idarucizumab (monoclonal antibody, specific reversal)
  - Factor Xa inhibitors (apixaban, rivaroxaban, edoxaban): Andexanet alfa (recombinant factor Xa, specific reversal)
  - UFH: Protamine sulfate

**Post-PE syndrome**:
- Persistent dyspnea, exercise intolerance, reduced quality of life
- Multifactorial: Deconditioning, RV dysfunction, CTEPH
- Rehabilitation, pulmonary vasodilators (if CTEPH)

## Prognosis

**Overall mortality**:
- Untreated PE: 25-30%
- Treated PE: 2-8%

**Risk stratification**:

*High-risk (massive) PE*:
- Hemodynamic instability
- Mortality: >15% (30% if cardiac arrest)

*Intermediate-risk (submassive) PE*:
- Hemodynamically stable with RV dysfunction or myocardial injury
- Mortality: 3-15%

*Low-risk PE*:
- Hemodynamically stable, no RV dysfunction or myocardial injury
- Mortality: <1%

**Prognostic scores**:
- **Pulmonary Embolism Severity Index (PESI)**: 11 variables, predicts 30-day mortality
  - PESI Class I-II: Low risk (<2% mortality), consider outpatient treatment
  - PESI Class III-V: Higher risk, hospitalize
- **Simplified PESI (sPESI)**: 6 variables (age >80, cancer, chronic cardiopulmonary disease, HR ≥110, SBP <100, SpO₂ <90%)
  - sPESI = 0: Low risk, outpatient candidate
  - sPESI ≥1: Higher risk

**Predictors of poor prognosis**:
- Hemodynamic instability
- RV dysfunction (echocardiography, CT)
- Elevated troponin, BNP
- Hypoxemia, acidosis
- Comorbidities (cancer, chronic heart/lung disease)
- Age >70 years

**Outpatient treatment**:
- Selected low-risk patients (PESI class I-II or sPESI = 0)
- No contraindications to outpatient care
- Anticoagulation with DOAC or LMWH
- Close follow-up

## Key Points

- Pulmonary embolism is the third most common acute cardiovascular syndrome; early diagnosis and anticoagulation reduce mortality from 25-30% (untreated) to 2-8%
- Clinical probability assessment (Wells score) combined with D-dimer testing can safely exclude PE in low-risk patients without imaging
- CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA) is the gold standard imaging modality; V/Q scan is an alternative when contrast is contraindicated
- Risk stratification is critical: massive PE (hemodynamically unstable, >15% mortality) requires thrombolysis; low-risk PE (<1% mortality) can often be managed as outpatient
- Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are preferred over warfarin for most patients due to fixed dosing, no monitoring, and lower intracranial hemorrhage risk
- Duration of anticoagulation: 3 months for provoked PE with transient risk factor; consider extended (indefinite) anticoagulation for unprovoked PE after reassessing bleeding risk
- Thrombolytic therapy reduces mortality in massive PE but increases bleeding risk (10-20% major bleeding, 1-3% ICH); use only for hemodynamically unstable patients
- IVC filters are reserved for absolute contraindications to anticoagulation or recurrent PE despite therapeutic anticoagulation; they do not prevent PE and have complications
