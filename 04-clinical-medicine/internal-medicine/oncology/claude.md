# Oncology

## Overview

Oncology is the medical specialty dedicated to the diagnosis, treatment, and management of cancer. Cancer represents a heterogeneous group of diseases characterized by uncontrolled cell growth, invasion of local tissues, and potential metastasis to distant organs. Understanding the molecular biology of cancer, principles of cancer screening and staging, and multimodal treatment approaches is essential for all physicians, as cancer is the second leading cause of death globally.

### Epidemiology

**Global burden**:
- 19.3 million new cancer cases annually worldwide (2020)
- 10 million cancer deaths annually
- Most common cancers globally: Lung, breast, colorectal, prostate, stomach
- Leading causes of cancer death: Lung, colorectal, liver, stomach, breast

**United States**:
- 1.9 million new cancer cases annually
- 610,000 cancer deaths annually
- Second leading cause of death (after heart disease)
- 1 in 3 people will develop cancer in their lifetime
- 5-year relative survival: 68% (all cancers combined)

**Most common cancers (US incidence)**:
- Breast: 300,000 cases/year
- Lung: 230,000 cases/year
- Prostate: 290,000 cases/year
- Colorectal: 150,000 cases/year

**Risk factors**:
- Tobacco use (30% of cancer deaths)
- Obesity and physical inactivity (20%)
- Infections (hepatitis B/C, HPV, H. pylori, EBV): 15-20%
- Alcohol consumption
- Environmental exposures (UV radiation, carcinogens)
- Hereditary cancer syndromes (5-10%)

## Cancer Biology

### Hallmarks of Cancer

**Ten hallmarks** (Hanahan and Weinberg):
1. **Sustaining proliferative signaling**: Autonomous growth signals
2. **Evading growth suppressors**: Loss of tumor suppressors (p53, RB)
3. **Resisting cell death**: Inhibition of apoptosis (BCL-2 overexpression)
4. **Enabling replicative immortality**: Telomerase activation
5. **Inducing angiogenesis**: VEGF secretion, new blood vessel formation
6. **Activating invasion and metastasis**: EMT, degradation of ECM
7. **Reprogramming energy metabolism**: Warburg effect (aerobic glycolysis)
8. **Evading immune destruction**: PD-L1 expression, immune checkpoint activation
9. **Genome instability and mutation**: DNA repair defects, chromosomal instability
10. **Tumor-promoting inflammation**: Inflammatory cells support tumor growth

### Carcinogenesis

**Multi-step process**:
- **Initiation**: DNA damage (mutations in oncogenes, tumor suppressors)
- **Promotion**: Clonal expansion of initiated cells
- **Progression**: Additional mutations, genomic instability
- **Invasion and metastasis**: Local invasion → intravasation → survival in circulation → extravasation → colonization

**Driver vs. passenger mutations**:
- **Driver mutations**: Confer growth advantage (TP53, KRAS, EGFR, BRAF)
- **Passenger mutations**: Neutral mutations (no selective advantage)

**Oncogenes**:
- Gain-of-function mutations promote cell growth
- Examples: RAS, MYC, HER2, BCR-ABL, BRAF

**Tumor suppressor genes**:
- Loss-of-function (two-hit hypothesis)
- Examples: TP53, RB, APC, BRCA1/2, PTEN

## Cancer Screening

**Principles of screening**:
- Detect cancer at earlier, more curable stage
- Benefits outweigh harms (false positives, overdiagnosis, procedural complications)
- Cost-effective
- Target high-risk populations

**US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendations**:

**Breast cancer**:
- Mammography every 2 years, ages 50-74 (Grade B)
- Ages 40-49: Individual decision (Grade C)
- Consider risk factors (family history, genetic mutations, breast density)

**Cervical cancer**:
- Pap smear every 3 years, ages 21-29
- Pap + HPV co-testing every 5 years or Pap alone every 3 years, ages 30-65
- HPV testing alone every 5 years, ages 30-65

**Colorectal cancer**:
- Begin age 45-75 (Grade A), individualize 76-85 (Grade C)
- Options: Colonoscopy every 10 years, annual FIT, FIT-DNA every 3 years, flexible sigmoidoscopy every 5 years

**Lung cancer**:
- Low-dose CT annually, ages 50-80 with 20 pack-year smoking history and currently smoke or quit within past 15 years (Grade B)

**Prostate cancer**:
- PSA screening: Individual decision ages 55-69 (Grade C)
- Discuss benefits and harms with patients

## Tumor Markers

**Diagnostic and monitoring**:
- **PSA** (prostate-specific antigen): Prostate cancer screening, monitoring
- **CEA** (carcinoembryonic antigen): Colorectal cancer monitoring
- **CA 19-9**: Pancreatic cancer, cholangiocarcinoma
- **CA 125**: Ovarian cancer
- **AFP** (alpha-fetoprotein): Hepatocellular carcinoma, germ cell tumors
- **hCG** (human chorionic gonadotropin): Germ cell tumors, gestational trophoblastic disease
- **CA 15-3, CA 27-29**: Breast cancer monitoring
- **Thyroglobulin**: Differentiated thyroid cancer
- **Calcitonin**: Medullary thyroid cancer

**Limitations**:
- Not specific for cancer (elevated in benign conditions)
- Not sensitive enough for screening (low positive predictive value)
- Used primarily for monitoring response to treatment and detecting recurrence

## Staging

**TNM staging system** (American Joint Committee on Cancer):
- **T** (Tumor): Size and extent of primary tumor (T0-T4)
- **N** (Nodes): Regional lymph node involvement (N0-N3)
- **M** (Metastasis): Distant metastasis (M0 = no metastasis, M1 = metastasis)

**Staging**:
- Stage 0: Carcinoma in situ
- Stage I-II: Localized disease
- Stage III: Regional lymph node involvement
- Stage IV: Distant metastasis

**Importance**:
- Prognosis
- Treatment planning
- Clinical trial eligibility
- Standardized communication

## Treatment Modalities

**Surgery**:
- Curative resection (localized disease)
- Debulking (cytoreductive surgery)
- Palliative (symptom relief, complications)

**Radiation therapy**:
- External beam radiation
- Brachytherapy (internal radiation)
- Stereotactic radiosurgery
- Indications: Curative, adjuvant, neoadjuvant, palliative

**Systemic therapy**:
- **Chemotherapy**: Cytotoxic agents (alkylators, antimetabolites, anthracyclines, taxanes, platinum agents)
- **Targeted therapy**: Small molecule inhibitors, monoclonal antibodies (EGFR, HER2, VEGF, BRAF, ALK inhibitors)
- **Immunotherapy**: Checkpoint inhibitors (PD-1/PD-L1, CTLA-4), CAR T-cell therapy
- **Hormonal therapy**: Breast cancer (tamoxifen, aromatase inhibitors), prostate cancer (androgen deprivation)

**Multimodal therapy**:
- Combination of surgery, radiation, systemic therapy
- Neoadjuvant: Before surgery (downstage tumor, assess response)
- Adjuvant: After surgery (eliminate micrometastases)

## Common Cancers

- Focus on symptom control, psychosocial support, advance care planning
- Not limited to end-of-life care

**Hospice care**:
- End-of-life care (prognosis <6 months)
- Comfort-focused, not curative
- Interdisciplinary team (physicians, nurses, social workers, chaplains)

## Survivorship

**Growing population**:
- 18 million cancer survivors in US (2022)
- Expected to reach 22 million by 2030

**Survivorship care**:
- Surveillance for recurrence
- Management of late effects (cardiac, pulmonary, endocrine, fertility, psychosocial)
- Secondary cancer screening
- Health promotion (nutrition, exercise, smoking cessation)
- Transition from oncology to primary care

**Late effects**:
- Cardiovascular toxicity (anthracyclines, radiation, trastuzumab)
- Pulmonary fibrosis (bleomycin, radiation)
- Peripheral neuropathy (taxanes, platinum agents, vincristine)
- Infertility (alkylating agents, pelvic radiation)
- Secondary malignancies (therapy-related AML/MDS)
- Cognitive impairment ("chemo brain")
- Psychosocial issues (anxiety, depression, PTSD, fear of recurrence)

## Key Points

- Cancer is the second leading cause of death globally; most common cancers are lung, breast, colorectal, and prostate
- Hallmarks of cancer include sustaining proliferative signaling, evading growth suppressors, resisting cell death, enabling replicative immortality, inducing angiogenesis, and activating invasion/metastasis
- Cancer screening reduces mortality for breast (mammography), cervical (Pap/HPV), colorectal (colonoscopy, FIT), and lung cancer (low-dose CT in high-risk smokers)
- TNM staging (Tumor, Nodes, Metastasis) guides prognosis and treatment; Stage I-II is localized, Stage III has regional nodes, Stage IV has distant metastasis
- Cancer treatment is multimodal: surgery (curative resection), radiation (local control), systemic therapy (chemotherapy, targeted therapy, immunotherapy, hormonal therapy)
- Tumor markers (PSA, CEA, CA 19-9, CA 125, AFP) are used for monitoring treatment response and detecting recurrence, not screening
- Supportive care addresses symptoms, oncologic emergencies, and psychosocial needs; early palliative care integration improves quality of life and potentially survival
