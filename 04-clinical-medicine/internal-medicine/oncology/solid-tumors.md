# Solid Tumors

## Overview

Solid tumors are malignant neoplasms arising from epithelial, mesenchymal, or neural tissues that form discrete masses, as opposed to hematologic malignancies. This chapter focuses on the most common solid tumors: lung cancer, breast cancer, colorectal cancer, and prostate cancer, which collectively account for nearly half of all cancer diagnoses and deaths in developed countries.

### Epidemiology

**Cancer burden globally**:
- 19.3 million new cancer cases worldwide in 2020
- 10 million cancer deaths annually
- Leading cause of death globally (1 in 6 deaths)

**Most common solid tumors** (United States):
1. Breast cancer: 290,000 cases/year (30% of female cancers)
2. Lung cancer: 235,000 cases/year (12% of all cancers)
3. Prostate cancer: 268,000 cases/year (27% of male cancers)
4. Colorectal cancer: 150,000 cases/year (8% of all cancers)

### Risk Factors

**Modifiable risk factors**:
- Tobacco use (30% of cancer deaths)
- Obesity and physical inactivity (20%)
- Alcohol consumption (6%)
- Infections (HPV, HBV, HCV, H. pylori): 15%
- Environmental exposures (radiation, asbestos, radon)
- Diet (processed meats, low fiber)

**Non-modifiable risk factors**:
- Age (most important single factor)
- Family history and genetic syndromes
- Sex and hormonal factors
- Race and ethnicity

## Lung Cancer

### Overview

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide, accounting for more deaths than breast, prostate, and colorectal cancers combined. Despite being largely preventable (85% attributable to smoking), it remains highly lethal due to late-stage diagnosis.

### Epidemiology

- **Incidence**: 235,000 new cases/year in US
- **Mortality**: 130,000 deaths/year (highest cancer mortality)
- **5-year survival**: 21% overall, 60% if localized, 6% if distant
- **Age**: Median age 70 years at diagnosis
- **Sex**: Historically male predominant, now nearly equal

### Classification

**Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)**: 85% of cases
- **Adenocarcinoma** (40-50%): Most common, peripheral, associated with smoking and non-smokers
- **Squamous cell carcinoma** (25-30%): Central, strongly associated with smoking, cavitation common
- **Large cell carcinoma** (5-10%): Poorly differentiated, peripheral or central

**Small cell lung cancer (SCLC)**: 15% of cases
- Highly aggressive, rapid doubling time
- Strong association with smoking (>95%)
- Paraneoplastic syndromes common
- Early metastasis typical

### Risk Factors

**Smoking**:
- 85% of lung cancer attributable to smoking
- Risk proportional to pack-years (packs/day × years)
- 20-40 fold increased risk in smokers
- Risk decreases after cessation (50% reduction after 10 years)

**Other risk factors**:
- Environmental tobacco smoke (secondhand smoke): 15-20% increased risk
- Radon exposure: Second leading cause in US
- Occupational exposures: Asbestos, arsenic, chromium, nickel

- Peau d'orange
- No discrete mass often
- Aggressive, stage IIIB minimum
- Poor prognosis

### Diagnosis

**Imaging**:

*Mammography*:

- After mastectomy: If ≥4+ nodes, T3-4, or positive margins
- Regional nodal irradiation: If 1-3+ nodes or high-risk features

*Systemic therapy* (adjuvant):

**Endocrine therapy** (ER+ and/or PR+):
- Premenopausal: Tamoxifen 5-10 years ± ovarian suppression
- Postmenopausal: Aromatase inhibitor (AI: letrozole, anastrozole, exemestane) 5-10 years or tamoxifen → AI (sequential)

## Colorectal Cancer

### Overview

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer and third leading cause of cancer death in both men and women. Most cases arise from adenomatous polyps over 10-15 years, providing opportunity for prevention through screening.

### Epidemiology

- **Incidence**: 150,000 new cases/year in US (decreasing due to screening)
- **Mortality**: 53,000 deaths/year
- **Lifetime risk**: 1 in 23 (4.3%)
- **5-year survival**: 65% overall, 90% if localized, 15% if distant
- **Age**: Median age 67 years, but increasing incidence <50 years

### Risk Factors

**Strong risk factors**:
- Age >50 (90% of cases)
- Inflammatory bowel disease (UC, Crohn's): 1-2% per year after 8-10 years
- Hereditary syndromes:
  - Lynch syndrome (HNPCC): 70-80% lifetime risk
  - Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP): 100% by age 40 if untreated
  - MUTYH-associated polyposis
- Personal history of colorectal polyps or cancer
- Family history: First-degree relative (2-3 fold risk)

**Moderate risk factors**:
- Type 2 diabetes
- Obesity

- Diet: High red/processed meat, low fiber

**Protective factors**:
- Aspirin/NSAIDs (30-40% reduction, but bleeding risk)
- Physical activity
- Adequate calcium and vitamin D
- High-fiber diet

### Pathogenesis

**Adenoma-carcinoma sequence** (classical pathway):
- Normal mucosa → aberrant crypt foci → adenomatous polyp → dysplasia → invasive carcinoma
- 10-15 year progression
- APC mutation → KRAS mutation → TP53 mutation

**Serrated pathway**:
- Hyperplastic polyp → sessile serrated adenoma → carcinoma
- BRAF mutation, CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP)
- MLH1 methylation → microsatellite instability (MSI-high)

**Lynch syndrome pathway**:
- Germline mutation in mismatch repair genes (MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2)
- Microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H)
- Deficient mismatch repair (dMMR)

### Clinical Presentation

**Symptoms** (depend on location):

*Right colon*:
- Occult bleeding → iron deficiency anemia (fatigue, dyspnea)
- Abdominal pain (dull, vague)
- Mass (late)
- Large bowel diameter → rarely obstructs

*Left colon/rectum*:
- Hematochezia (bright red blood)
- Change in bowel habits (constipation, diarrhea, narrowing)
- Tenesmus (rectal)
- Obstruction (small caliber)

**Common presentations**:

## Prostate Cancer

### Overview

Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men (excluding skin cancer) and the second leading cause of cancer death in men. Most cases are indolent, slow-growing tumors, but aggressive variants exist.

### Epidemiology

- **Incidence**: 268,000 new cases/year in US
- **Mortality**: 34,000 deaths/year
- **Lifetime risk**: 1 in 8 men (13%)
- **5-year survival**: 97% overall, >99% if localized/regional, 31% if distant
- **Age**: Rare <50 years, median age 67 at diagnosis
- **Race**: African American men have 2-fold higher incidence and mortality

### Risk Factors

**Strong risk factors**:
- Age: Incidence increases exponentially after age 50
- Race: African American > White > Asian
- Family history: 2-fold risk if one first-degree relative, higher if multiple or young relatives
- BRCA2 mutation (7-fold risk), BRCA1, Lynch syndrome, HOXB13

**Possible risk factors**:
- Diet: High saturated fat, low vegetables/fruits
- Obesity (associated with aggressive disease)
- Smoking (aggressive disease)

**Protective factors**:
- 5-alpha reductase inhibitors (finasteride, dutasteride): 25% reduction but controversial (may increase high-grade tumors)

### Clinical Presentation

**Localized disease** (most common):
- **Asymptomatic**: 80-90% detected by PSA screening
- Digital rectal exam (DRE): Nodule, induration, asymmetry

**Locally advanced**:
- Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS): Frequency, urgency, weak stream, nocturia
- Hematuria
- Erectile dysfunction
- Hematospermia

**Metastatic**:
- Bone pain (bone metastases, most common site)
- Pathologic fractures
- Spinal cord compression: Back pain, weakness, incontinence
- Lower extremity edema (lymphatic obstruction)
- Weight loss, fatigue

### Diagnosis

**Screening** (controversial):

*PSA (prostate-specific antigen)*:
- Discuss with men age 55-69 (shared decision-making)
- Consider earlier in African American men, family history
- Not recommended age ≥70
- Frequency: Every 2-4 years if screening

*PSA interpretation*:
- <4 ng/mL: Generally normal (but can have cancer)
- 4-10 ng/mL: Gray zone (25% cancer risk)
- >10 ng/mL: High suspicion (>50% cancer risk)
- PSA velocity: Increase >0.75 ng/mL/year concerning
- Age-adjusted PSA, PSA density, free/total PSA ratio (refine risk)

*Digital rectal examination (DRE)*:
- Palpate prostate (nodule, induration)
- Adjunct to PSA

**Diagnosis**:

*Multiparametric MRI (mpMRI)*:
- Increasingly used before biopsy
- PI-RADS score 1-5 (5 = highly suspicious)
- Guides biopsy, detects anterior tumors missed by standard biopsy

*Prostate biopsy*:
- **Transrectal ultrasound (TRUS)-guided biopsy**: 12-core systematic ± targeted (if mpMRI lesion)
- **Transperineal biopsy**: Lower infection risk, increasing use
- Complications: Hematuria, hematospermia, infection (rare, 1-2%)

*Pathology*:
- **Gleason score** (critical):
  - Grades 1-5 based on architecture
  - Sum of two most common patterns (e.g., 3+4=7)
  - Grade group (simplified):
    - Group 1: Gleason 6 (3+3) - lowest risk
    - Group 2: Gleason 7 (3+4)
    - Group 3: Gleason 7 (4+3)
    - Group 4: Gleason 8 (4+4, 3+5, 5+3)
    - Group 5: Gleason 9-10 (4+5, 5+4, 5+5) - highest risk
- Number and % of cores involved
- Perineural invasion

### Staging

**TNM staging**:

*Clinical stage (before treatment)*:
- **T1**: Not palpable/visible
  - T1c: PSA-detected
- **T2**: Confined to prostate
  - T2a: ≤50% of one lobe
  - T2b: >50% of one lobe
  - T2c: Both lobes
- **T3**: Extends beyond prostate
  - T3a: Extracapsular extension
  - T3b: Seminal vesicle invasion
- **T4**: Invades adjacent structures (bladder, rectum, pelvic wall)

*Nodes (N)*:
- N0: No nodes
- N1: Regional lymph nodes

*Metastasis (M)*:
- M0: No metastasis
- M1: Distant metastasis (M1a: non-regional nodes, M1b: bone, M1c: other)

**Risk stratification** (NCCN):

*Very low risk*:
- T1c, Grade Group 1, PSA <10, <3 cores positive, ≤50% any core, PSA density <0.15

*Low risk*:
- T1-T2a, Grade Group 1, PSA <10

*Intermediate risk*:
- T2b-T2c or Grade Group 2-3 or PSA 10-20

*High risk*:
- T3a or Grade Group 4-5 or PSA >20

*Very high risk*:
- T3b-T4 or primary Gleason 5 or ≥2 high-risk features

### Treatment

**Localized disease**:

*Very low/low risk*:
- **Active surveillance**: Preferred for very low/favorable low risk
  - PSA every 3-6 months
  - DRE, MRI
  - Repeat biopsy within 6-12 months, then periodically
  - Defer treatment unless progression
  - Preserves quality of life (avoid treatment side effects)
  - 10-year cancer-specific survival >99%

*Intermediate/high risk*:
- **Radical prostatectomy** (RP): Open, laparoscopic, robotic
  - ± pelvic lymph node dissection
  - Side effects: Erectile dysfunction (30-70%), urinary incontinence (10-20%)
- **Radiation therapy**:
  - External beam (EBRT): 7-9 weeks
  - Brachytherapy: Low-dose rate (LDR) seeds (monotherapy for low risk)
  - High-dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy
  - Side effects: Bowel urgency/bleeding, urinary symptoms, erectile dysfunction
- **Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT)** adjunct:
  - With radiation for intermediate/high risk (4-36 months)

*Outcomes*:
- Cure rates similar for RP vs radiation
- 10-year cancer-specific survival: >95% (low/intermediate), 85-90% (high)

**Locally advanced/high-risk**:
- Radiation + long-term ADT (2-3 years)
- ± chemotherapy (docetaxel) for very high risk

**Metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC)**:
- **ADT** (backbone):
  - GnRH agonists (leuprolide, goserelin) or antagonists (degarelix, relugolix)
  - Bilateral orchiectomy
  - Side effects: Hot flashes, decreased libido, erectile dysfunction, osteoporosis, metabolic changes
- **ADT + intensification**:
  - Docetaxel chemotherapy (6 cycles) or
  - Abiraterone (CYP17 inhibitor) + prednisone or
  - Apalutamide or enzalutamide (androgen receptor inhibitors)
  - Improves survival vs ADT alone
- Median survival: 5+ years

**Metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC)**:
- Define: PSA/radiographic progression despite castrate testosterone
- **Options** (sequential):
  - Abiraterone + prednisone
  - Enzalutamide or apalutamide or darolutamide
  - Docetaxel chemotherapy
  - Cabazitaxel chemotherapy
  - Sipuleucel-T (immunotherapy)
  - Radium-223 (bone metastases)
  - PARP inhibitors (BRCA1/2, ATM mutations): Olaparib, rucaparib
  - Pembrolizumab (MSI-high/dMMR)
- Median survival: 2-3 years from mCRPC

### Surveillance

- After treatment: PSA every 3-6 months for 5 years, then annually
- PSA recurrence (biochemical recurrence):
  - After RP: PSA ≥0.2 ng/mL
  - After radiation: PSA rise ≥2 ng/mL above nadir
- DRE annually

## Key Points

- Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death; 85% is attributable to smoking, with adenocarcinoma being the most common type (40-50%)
- NSCLC should undergo molecular testing for EGFR, ALK, ROS1, BRAF, and PD-L1 to guide targeted therapy and immunotherapy decisions
- SCLC is highly aggressive with early metastasis; limited-stage disease is treated with concurrent chemoradiation and extensive-stage with chemotherapy plus immunotherapy
- Breast cancer molecular subtypes (Luminal A/B, HER2-enriched, triple-negative) are critical for treatment selection and prognosis
- Early-stage breast cancer treatment includes surgery (BCS + radiation or mastectomy), adjuvant endocrine therapy for ER+, HER2-targeted therapy for HER2+, and chemotherapy based on risk
- Colorectal cancer screening starting at age 45-50 has reduced incidence and mortality; colonoscopy is the gold standard
- CRC staging dictates treatment: stage III requires adjuvant chemotherapy (FOLFOX/CAPOX), rectal cancer often receives neoadjuvant chemoradiation
- Prostate cancer screening with PSA is controversial; discuss with men 55-69 years and consider active surveillance for very low/low-risk disease
- Gleason score/Grade Group is the most important prognostic factor in prostate cancer, ranging from Grade Group 1 (Gleason 6) to 5 (Gleason 9-10)
- Metastatic prostate cancer is treated with ADT plus intensification (docetaxel, abiraterone, or apalutamide/enzalutamide) in hormone-sensitive disease
