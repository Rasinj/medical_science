# Palliative Oncology and End-of-Life Care

## Overview

Palliative care is specialized medical care focused on providing relief from symptoms and stress of serious illness, with the goal of improving quality of life for both patients and families. In oncology, palliative care is appropriate at any stage of disease, from diagnosis through treatment, survivorship, or end-of-life care. It complements curative or life-prolonging therapies and addresses physical, psychosocial, and spiritual needs.

### Definitions

**Palliative care**:
- Specialized medical care for people living with serious illness
- Focused on symptom relief and quality of life
- Appropriate at any stage of illness, alongside disease-directed therapy
- Team-based: Physicians, nurses, social workers, chaplains, others

**Hospice care**:
- Type of palliative care for people in the final months of life (prognosis ≤6 months)
- Emphasis on comfort, dignity, quality of life
- Discontinue disease-directed therapy (curative intent)
- Comprehensive support: Medical, nursing, psychosocial, spiritual, bereavement
- Medicare hospice benefit covers all services related to terminal illness

**Supportive care**:
- Broad term encompassing interventions to prevent and manage side effects of cancer and treatment
- Overlaps with palliative care

### Principles of Palliative Oncology

**Core principles**:
1. Relief of pain and other distressing symptoms
2. Affirm life, regard dying as a normal process
3. Neither hasten nor postpone death
4. Integrate psychological and spiritual aspects of care
5. Support patient to live as actively as possible
6. Support family during illness and bereavement
7. Team approach, addressing broad needs
8. Improve quality of life, may positively influence course of illness

**Who benefits**:
- All patients with serious cancer diagnoses
- Early integration improves quality of life, mood, and may prolong survival
- High symptom burden
- Advanced/metastatic disease
- Complex decision-making needs

### Evidence for Palliative Care

- Early palliative care integration (at diagnosis of metastatic cancer):
  - Improves quality of life
  - Reduces depression
  - Decreases aggressive end-of-life care (ICU admissions, chemotherapy near death)
  - May prolong survival (demonstrated in lung cancer)
- Timing: Ideally within 8 weeks of diagnosis of advanced cancer

## Pain Management

### Overview

Pain affects 50-70% of cancer patients during treatment and 60-90% with advanced disease. Adequate pain control is achievable in 80-90% of patients with appropriate therapy. Undertreatment remains common due to inadequate assessment, opioid phobia, and knowledge gaps.

### Assessment

**Comprehensive pain assessment**:
- **Onset**: Acute vs chronic
- **Location**: Primary site(s), radiation
- **Quality**: Sharp, dull, burning, aching, shooting
- **Intensity**: Numeric rating scale (0-10), visual analog scale
- **Temporal pattern**: Constant, intermittent, breakthrough
- **Aggravating/alleviating factors**
- **Impact**: Function, sleep, mood, social interactions
- **Previous treatments**: What has/hasn't worked
- **Goals**: Patient expectations and preferences

**Pain types**:
- **Nociceptive pain**: Tissue injury
  - Somatic: Bone metastases, incision, musculoskeletal (sharp, localized)
  - Visceral: Organ involvement, obstruction (dull, diffuse, cramping)
- **Neuropathic pain**: Nerve damage (burning, shooting, tingling, numbness)
  - Tumor compression, chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy, radiation injury
- **Mixed pain**: Combination (most cancer pain)

**Reassessment**:
- Frequent, regular intervals
- After any intervention (15-30 min for IV, 1 hour for oral)
- Document response, adjust as needed

### Pharmacologic Management

**WHO Analgesic Ladder** (stepwise approach):

**Step 1: Mild pain (1-3/10)**:
- Non-opioid analgesics: Acetaminophen, NSAIDs
- ± Adjuvants

**Step 2: Moderate pain (4-6/10)**:
- Weak opioids: Codeine, tramadol
- OR low-dose strong opioids: Morphine, oxycodone
- ± Non-opioid analgesics
- ± Adjuvants

**Step 3: Severe pain (7-10/10)**:
- Strong opioids: Morphine, oxycodone, hydromorphone, fentanyl, methadone
- ± Non-opioid analgesics
- ± Adjuvants

### Non-Opioid Analgesics

**Acetaminophen**:
- Mechanism: Central COX inhibition (uncertain)
- Dose: 650-1000 mg every 4-6 hours (maximum 4 g/day; 3 g/day if elderly, liver disease, alcohol use)
- Well-tolerated, minimal side effects
- Hepatotoxicity with overdose

**NSAIDs** (ibuprofen, naproxen, ketorolac):
- Mechanism: COX inhibition, reduce prostaglandin synthesis
- Effective for bone pain, inflammatory pain
- Side effects: GI (ulcers, bleeding), renal insufficiency, cardiovascular (long-term), platelet dysfunction
- Contraindications: Severe renal disease, bleeding risk, thrombocytopenia
- Consider PPI for GI protection if prolonged use

**COX-2 selective inhibitors** (celecoxib):
- Less GI toxicity than non-selective NSAIDs
- Still carry cardiovascular risk
- Do not inhibit platelets

### Opioid Analgesics

**General principles**:
- Cornerstone of moderate-to-severe cancer pain
- No ceiling dose (titrate to effect)
- Individualized therapy
- Schedule around-the-clock for chronic pain + breakthrough (PRN) doses
- Start low, go slow (especially opioid-naive, elderly, renal/hepatic impairment)
- Equianalgesic dosing when rotating opioids (reduce new opioid by 25-50% due to incomplete cross-tolerance)

**Common opioids**:

*Morphine*:
- First-line, gold standard
- Immediate-release (IR): 15-30 mg PO every 4 hours
- Extended-release (ER): Every 8-12 hours
- IV/SC: 1/3 of oral dose (bioavailability ~30%)
- Metabolites: Morphine-6-glucuronide (active), morphine-3-glucuronide (neurotoxic)
- Caution in renal failure (accumulation)

*Oxycodone*:
- IR: 5-10 mg PO every 4-6 hours
- ER: Every 12 hours
- No IV formulation (oral only)
- Slightly more potent than morphine (1.5:1 ratio)

*Hydromorphone*:
- 5-7× more potent than morphine
- IR: 2-4 mg PO every 4 hours
- IV: 0.2-0.6 mg every 2-3 hours
- Preferred in renal failure (less toxic metabolites)

*Fentanyl*:
- 100× more potent than morphine
- Highly lipophilic
- **Transdermal patch**: 12.5-100 mcg/hr every 72 hours
  - Steady state 12-24 hours, continue short-acting opioid during titration
  - For opioid-tolerant patients only (≥60 mg oral morphine equivalents/day)
  - Useful for dysphagia, nausea, poor oral intake
- **Buccal/sublingual/nasal**: Rapid-onset for breakthrough pain
- IV/SC: 0.025-0.1 mg every 1-2 hours

*Methadone*:
- Long half-life (8-59 hours, variable)
- NMDA antagonist (effective for neuropathic pain)
- Complex dosing, risk of accumulation
- QTc prolongation (obtain baseline and follow-up ECG)
- Requires expertise, not first-line

**Dosing strategies**:

*Opioid-naive patient*:
- Start with short-acting opioid (morphine IR 15 mg every 4 hours or equivalent)
- Provide breakthrough dose (10-20% of total daily dose) every 1-2 hours PRN
- Titrate every 24-48 hours based on total opioid use
- Convert to long-acting formulation once stable dose achieved

*Opioid-tolerant patient*:
- Increase total daily dose by 25-50% if inadequate pain control
- Adjust breakthrough dose proportionally

*Breakthrough pain*:
- 10-20% of total daily opioid dose
- Can be given as frequently as every 1 hour (oral) or 15-30 min (IV/SC)
- If >3-4 breakthrough doses per day, increase scheduled dose

**Opioid rotation**:
- Indications: Inadequate analgesia despite escalation, intolerable side effects
- Calculate equianalgesic dose, reduce by 25-50% (incomplete cross-tolerance)
- Exception: Fentanyl transdermal (no dose reduction when rotating to fentanyl)

**Opioid side effects**:

*Constipation*:
- Universal (tolerance does NOT develop)
- **Prophylaxis**: ALL patients on opioids
  - Stimulant laxative (senna) + stool softener (docusate) OR
  - Osmotic laxative (polyethylene glycol, lactulose)
- **Treatment**: Escalate laxatives, consider peripherally-acting mu-opioid receptor antagonists (methylnaltrexone, naloxegol) if refractory

*Nausea/vomiting*:
- Common at initiation, usually resolves in 5-7 days (tolerance develops)
- Prophylaxis: Consider antiemetic for first week (metoclopramide, prochlorperazine, ondansetron)
- If persistent: Rotate opioid

*Sedation*:
- Common initially, tolerance in 3-5 days
- If persistent: Reduce dose, rotate opioid, psychostimulant (methylphenidate)

*Respiratory depression*:
- Rare in opioid-tolerant patients with stable dosing
- Risk factors: Opioid-naive, rapid escalation, renal/hepatic failure, benzodiazepines
- Tolerance develops rapidly with chronic use
- Signs: Respiratory rate <8/min, oxygen saturation decline, altered mental status
- **Treatment**: Hold opioid, stimulate, oxygen, naloxone (0.04-0.4 mg IV, titrate to effect, may need repeated doses/infusion)

*Neurotoxicity*:
- Myoclonus, hyperalgesia, delirium, seizures (rare)
- Due to metabolite accumulation (morphine-3-glucuronide)
- Treatment: Hydration, rotate opioid (hydromorphone preferred)

### Adjuvant Analgesics

Used in conjunction with opioids, target specific pain mechanisms.

**Neuropathic pain**:

*Gabapentin*:
- Start 100-300 mg PO at bedtime, titrate to 900-3600 mg/day in 3 divided doses
- Side effects: Sedation, dizziness, peripheral edema
- Renal dose adjustment

*Pregabalin*:
- Start 75 mg PO twice daily, titrate to 150-300 mg twice daily
- Similar to gabapentin, potentially faster onset

*Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs)*:
- Amitriptyline, nortriptyline, desipramine
- Start 10-25 mg PO at bedtime, titrate to 75-150 mg
- Side effects: Anticholinergic (dry mouth, constipation, urinary retention), sedation, orthostasis, cardiac conduction abnormalities
- Contraindications: Prolonged QTc, recent MI, urinary retention, narrow-angle glaucoma

*SNRIs*:
- Duloxetine 30-60 mg daily, venlafaxine 37.5-225 mg daily
- Side effects: Nausea, headache, hypertension (venlafaxine)

*Topical agents*:
- Lidocaine patch 5%: Localized neuropathic pain
- Capsaicin cream: Neuropathic pain (initial burning, then desensitization)

**Bone pain**:

*NSAIDs*:
- First-line for bone metastases

*Bisphosphonates*:
- Zoledronic acid 4 mg IV every 3-4 weeks
- Reduce skeletal-related events and pain

*Denosumab*:
- 120 mg SC monthly
- RANKL inhibitor, more effective than bisphosphonates for skeletal-related events

*Radiation therapy*:
- Single fraction or short course (e.g., 30 Gy in 10 fractions)
- Pain relief in 50-80%, onset 2-4 weeks

*Radiopharmaceuticals*:
- Radium-223: Castration-resistant prostate cancer with bone metastases
- Strontium-89, samarium-153: Less commonly used

*Corticosteroids*:
- Dexamethasone 4-8 mg daily
- Anti-inflammatory, reduce peritu tumor edema
- Short-term use for bone pain, neuropathic pain, headache (brain metastases)

### Non-Pharmacologic Management

- **Radiation therapy**: Bone metastases, brain metastases, spinal cord compression
- **Interventional procedures**: Nerve blocks (celiac plexus for pancreatic cancer), neuraxial analgesia (intrathecal/epidural), vertebroplasty/kyphoplasty

  - NG tube only if refractory symptoms (avoid if possible)
  - Venting gastrostomy if prolonged survival expected

### Non-Pharmacologic Management

- Small, frequent meals
- Avoid strong odors, greasy/spicy foods
- Ginger, acupressure (P6 point)

## Anorexia and Cachexia

### Overview

**Cancer-associated anorexia-cachexia syndrome**:
- Complex metabolic syndrome characterized by loss of muscle mass (with or without fat loss) that cannot be fully reversed by nutritional support
- Multifactorial: Tumor-derived factors (cytokines), systemic inflammation, reduced intake, increased energy expenditure, metabolic abnormalities
- Affects 50-80% of advanced cancer patients
- Associated with decreased quality of life, poor treatment tolerance, shorter survival

### Assessment

- Weight history (% weight loss, timeframe)
- Dietary intake (24-hour recall, food diary)
- Functional status
- Symptoms limiting intake (nausea, early satiety, taste changes, dysphagia, pain)
- Physical exam: Muscle wasting (temporalis, interosseous, quadriceps), adipose tissue loss
- Labs: Albumin, prealbumin (acute phase reactants, not accurate for nutritional status in inflammation)

### Management

**Treat reversible causes**:
- Control pain, nausea, constipation, depression
- Optimize oral care (mucositis, xerostomia, thrush)
- Address dysphagia
- Modify medications contributing to anorexia

**Appetite stimulants**:

*Megestrol acetate*:
- Progestational agent
- Dose: 400-800 mg PO daily
- Improves appetite and weight (primarily fat, not muscle)
- Onset: 2-4 weeks
- Side effects: Thromboembolism (3-5%), adrenal suppression, hyperglycemia, hypogonadism, fluid retention
- Consider thromboprophylaxis if additional risk factors

*Corticosteroids*:
- Dexamethasone 2-4 mg PO daily or prednisone 10-20 mg daily
- Improve appetite, well-being, nausea (short-term, 2-4 weeks)
- Side effects limit long-term use: Myopathy (worsens muscle wasting), hyperglycemia, immunosuppression, delirium, insomnia

*Cannabinoids*:
- Dronabinol 2.5-5 mg PO twice daily
- Modest appetite stimulation
- Side effects: Sedation, dizziness, dysphoria (limit use in elderly)

*Olanzapine*:
- 2.5-5 mg PO daily
- Emerging evidence for appetite stimulation, weight gain

**Anabolic agents** (limited evidence):
- Oxandrolone (anabolic steroid): May increase lean body mass
- Side effects: Hepatotoxicity, virilization

**Exercise**:
- Resistance training may preserve muscle mass
- Challenging in advanced cancer

**Nutritional support**:
- High-calorie, high-protein diet
- Nutritionist consultation
- Small, frequent meals
- Calorie-dense foods
- Oral nutritional supplements
- **Enteral nutrition** (feeding tube): Consider if obstruction, severe dysphagia, and reasonable prognosis (weeks to months)
- **Parenteral nutrition**: Limited role in cancer cachexia, consider only if bowel obstruction and longer prognosis expected

## Hospice and End-of-Life Care

### Hospice Care

**Eligibility**:
- Life-limiting illness with prognosis ≤6 months (if disease runs normal course)
- Patient/family choose comfort-focused care over curative treatment
- Can recertify if patient lives beyond 6 months

**Services provided** (Medicare hospice benefit):
- Physician services (hospice medical director)
- Nursing care (visits and on-call 24/7)
- Home health aide, homemaker services
- Medical equipment (hospital bed, oxygen, wheelchair)
- Medications related to terminal diagnosis
- Counseling: Social work, spiritual, bereavement (for family after death)
- Respite care (short-term inpatient to relieve caregivers)
- Continuous care (crisis management at home)
- Inpatient care (symptom management, respite)

**Location**:
- Home (most common, 70%)
- Nursing facility
- Inpatient hospice facility
- Hospital

**Goals**:
- Symptom management, comfort
- Dignity, quality of life
- Support for patient and family
- Preparation for death

### Recognizing Imminent Death

**Days to weeks before death**:
- Increased sleep, withdrawn
- Decreased oral intake (normal, part of dying process)
- Decreased urine output
- Bedbound
- Difficulty concentrating

**Hours to days before death**:
- **Altered consciousness**: Unarousable or minimally responsive
- **Breathing changes**: Irregular, Cheyne-Stokes respirations, apnea periods
- **Death rattle**: Noisy, rattling breathing from secretions (patient likely unaware)
- **Mottling**: Skin discoloration, blue/purple patches on extremities
- **Peripheral cyanosis**: Cool extremities, decreased pulses
- **Loss of sphincter control**

### Symptom Management at End of Life

**Pain**:
- Continue scheduled opioids (parenteral if unable to swallow)
- Increase breakthrough doses (may need higher doses as dying)
- Consider subcutaneous, IV, rectal routes
- Sublingual/buccal fentanyl
- Transdermal fentanyl (if already on)

**Dyspnea**:
- Opioids (morphine, hydromorphone)
- Oxygen if hypoxic or patient/family comfort
- Fan
- Elevate head of bed

**Secretions (death rattle)**:
- Reassure family (patient likely not distressed)
- Positioning (side-lying, head elevated)
- Anticholinergics: Glycopyrrolate 0.2 mg SC every 4-6 hours or scopolamine patch
- Gentle oropharyngeal suctioning (if distressing to family)

**Delirium/agitation**:
- Terminal delirium (restlessness, agitation, confusion) common
- Treat reversible causes if appropriate (urinary retention, pain, medications)
- Haloperidol 0.5-2 mg PO/SC/IV every 4-6 hours
- Chlorpromazine 12.5-25 mg PO/PR/IV every 4-12 hours
- Lorazepam 0.5-2 mg PO/SL/SC/IV every 4-6 hours (adjunct)
- Refractory agitation: Phenobarbital, palliative sedation (last resort)

**Nausea/vomiting**:
- Continue antiemetics
- Parenteral/rectal routes if unable to swallow
- Haloperidol, prochlorperazine, scopolamine patch

**Anxiety**:
- Lorazepam 0.5-1 mg PO/SL/SC every 4-6 hours
- Reassurance, presence

**Discontinue non-comfort medications**:
- Antibiotics, antihypertensives, cardiac medications, antidiabetics, etc.
- Continue symptom-directed medications

**Artificial nutrition/hydration**:
- Generally not beneficial at end of life
- May increase secretions, edema, discomfort
- Mouth care more important than IV fluids

### Family Support

**Communication**:
- Prepare family for what to expect (physical changes, timeline)
- Encourage presence, verbal communication (hearing last sense to go)
- Normalize grief, emotions
- Provide reassurance about symptom management

**After death**:
- Allow time with body
- Bereavement support (hospice provides for 13 months after death)
- Grief counseling referrals if complicated grief

## Advance Care Planning

### Overview

Advance care planning involves discussions about goals, values, and preferences for future medical care, particularly in scenarios where patients cannot speak for themselves. It is a continuous process, not a one-time event.

### Components

**Advance directives**:
- Legal documents expressing wishes for medical care
- Two main types:

*Living will*:
- Written instructions about desired medical treatments in specific situations (e.g., terminal illness, persistent vegetative state)
- Addresses life-sustaining treatments: CPR, mechanical ventilation, dialysis, artificial nutrition/hydration

*Durable power of attorney for healthcare (healthcare proxy)*:
- Designates a person (healthcare agent/surrogate) to make medical decisions if patient unable
- More flexible than living will (covers unanticipated situations)
- Agent should know patient's values, preferences

**Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment (POLST)**:
- Medical order form (not advance directive)
- For seriously ill patients with life-limiting illness
- Addresses: CPR, medical interventions (comfort, limited, full), antibiotics, artificial nutrition
- Portable, recognized across settings (home, hospital, nursing home)
- Bright pink form, signed by physician

### Goals of Care Discussions

**When to have**:
- At cancer diagnosis (especially advanced)
- Change in clinical status
- Transition to palliative/hospice care
- Periodically (revisit, update)

**Approach**:
- Private, unhurried setting
- Ask patient preferences for family involvement
- Assess understanding of illness, prognosis
- Explore goals, values, priorities
- Discuss treatment options aligned with goals
- Address specific interventions: CPR, ICU, ventilation, dialysis, feeding tubes
- Allow emotional expression
- Document discussion, decisions

**Code status**:
- **Full code (CPR)**: Attempt resuscitation if cardiopulmonary arrest
- **DNR (do not resuscitate)**: No CPR if cardiopulmonary arrest
  - Does not mean "do not treat" (can still receive all other treatments)
- **DNI (do not intubate)**: No mechanical ventilation
- Other variations (facility-specific)

**Prognostic communication**:
- Patients want honest, realistic information
- Use ranges, acknowledge uncertainty
- "Hope for the best, prepare for the worst"
- Revisit if disease progresses

### Challenges

- Physician discomfort with discussions
- Cultural differences
- Family/patient discordance
- Unrealistic expectations

## Key Points

- Palliative care should be integrated early in advanced cancer (within 8 weeks of diagnosis) to improve quality of life, reduce depression, and decrease aggressive end-of-life care
- The WHO analgesic ladder provides a stepwise approach to cancer pain: non-opioids (mild), weak or low-dose strong opioids (moderate), strong opioids (severe), with adjuvants at any step
- Opioids are the cornerstone of moderate-to-severe cancer pain management; constipation is universal and requires prophylactic laxatives in all patients on chronic opioids
- Breakthrough pain dosing should be 10-20% of total daily opioid dose, administered as frequently as every 1 hour for oral or 15-30 minutes for IV/SC routes
- Neuropathic pain requires adjuvant analgesics (gabapentin, pregabalin, duloxetine, or TCAs) in addition to opioids for optimal control
- Dyspnea in advanced cancer is best managed with opioids (morphine 2.5-5 mg PO every 4 hours), which do not cause clinically significant respiratory depression at recommended doses
- Malignant bowel obstruction is managed medically with haloperidol, octreotide (antisecretory), anticholinergics, and opioids; NG tubes should be avoided if possible
- Hospice care is appropriate when prognosis is ≤6 months and patient/family choose comfort-focused care; it provides comprehensive medical, psychosocial, and spiritual support
- Terminal delirium and death rattle are common in the last days of life; death rattle is managed with anticholinergics (glycopyrrolate, scopolamine) and repositioning
- Advance care planning discussions should occur early in serious illness, address goals/values, and result in documented advance directives (living will, healthcare proxy) and POLST forms when appropriate
