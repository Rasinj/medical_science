# Principles of Oncology

## Overview

The principles of oncology encompass the fundamental concepts underlying cancer biology, carcinogenesis, cancer screening, diagnosis, staging, and treatment. Understanding these core principles is essential for the comprehensive care of cancer patients, from prevention and early detection through treatment and survivorship care.

### Cancer Definitions

**Cancer**: A group of diseases characterized by:
- Uncontrolled cell proliferation
- Invasion of local tissues
- Potential for metastasis to distant organs
- Loss of normal growth regulation

**Tumor**: Abnormal mass of tissue
- **Benign**: Non-invasive, well-differentiated, no metastasis
- **Malignant**: Invasive, variable differentiation, metastatic potential

**Carcinoma**: Malignancy arising from epithelial cells (85-90% of cancers)
**Sarcoma**: Malignancy arising from mesenchymal tissues (bone, cartilage, muscle, fat)
**Leukemia**: Malignancy of hematopoietic cells in blood and bone marrow
**Lymphoma**: Malignancy of lymphoid cells in lymph nodes and lymphoid tissues

### Cancer Statistics and Burden

**Global burden** (2020):
- 19.3 million new cancer cases
- 10 million cancer deaths
- Most common: Lung, breast, colorectal, prostate, stomach
- Leading causes of death: Lung, colorectal, liver, stomach, breast

**United States** (2023):
- 1.9 million new diagnoses
- 610,000 deaths
- Second leading cause of death (23% of all deaths)
- Lifetime risk: 1 in 2 for men, 1 in 3 for women
- 5-year relative survival: 68% (all cancers)

**Trends**:
- Overall cancer death rates declining (1.5% per year since 1991)
- Improvements due to: Screening, smoking reduction, treatment advances
- Rising incidence: Liver, thyroid, melanoma, HPV-related cancers
- Declining incidence: Lung, colorectal, stomach, cervical

## Pathophysiology

### Hallmarks of Cancer

**Original six hallmarks** (Hanahan and Weinberg, 2000):
1. **Self-sufficiency in growth signals**: Autonomous proliferation
2. **Insensitivity to anti-growth signals**: Loss of tumor suppressors
3. **Evading apoptosis**: Resistance to programmed cell death
4. **Limitless replicative potential**: Telomerase activation
5. **Sustained angiogenesis**: VEGF secretion, neovascularization
6. **Tissue invasion and metastasis**: Degradation of basement membrane, EMT

**Emerging hallmarks** (2011 update):
7. **Reprogramming energy metabolism**: Warburg effect (aerobic glycolysis)
8. **Evading immune destruction**: PD-L1 expression, immune checkpoints
9. **Genome instability and mutation**: DNA repair defects, chromosomal instability
10. **Tumor-promoting inflammation**: Inflammatory cells support tumor growth

### Carcinogenesis

**Multi-step process**:
1. **Initiation**: DNA damage in critical genes (oncogenes, tumor suppressors)
   - Chemical carcinogens, radiation, viruses
   - Random replication errors
2. **Promotion**: Clonal expansion of initiated cells
   - Growth factors, hormones, inflammatory mediators
3. **Progression**: Additional mutations, genomic instability
   - Increased malignant potential, heterogeneity
4. **Invasion and metastasis**: Breaking through basement membrane
   - Metastatic cascade: Local invasion → intravasation → circulation → extravasation → colonization

**Latency period**: Years to decades from initiation to clinical cancer

**Adenoma-carcinoma sequence** (colorectal cancer):
- Normal mucosa → aberrant crypt foci (APC mutation) → small adenoma → large adenoma (KRAS mutation) → carcinoma (TP53 mutation) → metastasis

### Genetic and Molecular Basis

**Driver mutations**: Confer selective growth advantage
- Oncogenes: KRAS, BRAF, EGFR, MYC, HER2
- Tumor suppressors: TP53, RB, APC, BRCA1/2, PTEN
- DNA repair genes: MLH1, MSH2, BRCA1/2

**Passenger mutations**: Neutral mutations, no selective advantage

**Types of genetic alterations**:
- **Point mutations**: Single nucleotide changes (KRAS G12D, BRAF V600E)
- **Deletions**: Loss of tumor suppressor genes (PTEN, TP53)
- **Amplifications**: Increased oncogene copies (HER2, EGFR, MYC)
- **Translocations**: Fusion genes (BCR-ABL, EML4-ALK, PML-RARA)
- **Epigenetic changes**: DNA methylation, histone modifications

**Oncogenes**:
- Normal cellular genes (proto-oncogenes) that promote cell growth
- Gain-of-function mutations create oncogenes
- Single mutated allele sufficient (dominant)
- Examples:
  - **RAS family** (KRAS, NRAS, HRAS): GTPase signaling (30% of cancers)
  - **MYC**: Transcription factor (Burkitt lymphoma)
  - **HER2**: Receptor tyrosine kinase (breast cancer)
  - **BCR-ABL**: Fusion tyrosine kinase (CML)
  - **BRAF**: Serine/threonine kinase (melanoma, colorectal cancer)

**Tumor suppressor genes**:
- Inhibit cell growth, promote differentiation or apoptosis
- Loss-of-function mutations release growth inhibition
- **Two-hit hypothesis** (Knudson): Both alleles must be inactivated (recessive)
- Examples:
  - **TP53**: "Guardian of the genome" (>50% of cancers)
    - DNA damage sensor, induces cell cycle arrest or apoptosis
    - Li-Fraumeni syndrome (germline TP53 mutation)
  - **RB**: Cell cycle regulator (retinoblastoma)
  - **APC**: Wnt pathway inhibitor (familial adenomatous polyposis)
  - **BRCA1/2**: DNA repair (hereditary breast/ovarian cancer)
  - **PTEN**: PI3K/AKT pathway inhibitor
  - **VHL**: HIF degradation (renal cell carcinoma)

**DNA repair genes**:
- Maintain genomic stability
- Defects lead to increased mutation rate
- Examples:
  - **Mismatch repair genes** (MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2): Lynch syndrome
  - **BRCA1/2**: Homologous recombination repair
  - **ATM**: DNA damage signaling (ataxia-telangiectasia)

### Tumor Microenvironment

**Components**:
- Cancer cells
- Stromal cells: Fibroblasts, endothelial cells, immune cells
- Extracellular matrix
- Signaling molecules: Growth factors, cytokines, chemokines

**Roles**:
- Supports tumor growth and survival
- Promotes angiogenesis
- Facilitates invasion and metastasis
- Modulates immune response
- Contributes to therapy resistance

**Cancer-associated fibroblasts** (CAFs):
- Secrete growth factors, ECM proteins
- Promote angiogenesis, invasion

**Tumor-associated macrophages** (TAMs):
- M2 polarization supports tumor growth
- Suppress anti-tumor immunity

**Angiogenesis**:
- VEGF secretion by tumor and stromal cells
- New blood vessels supply nutrients, oxygen
- Target for anti-angiogenic therapy (bevacizumab)

### Metastasis

**Metastatic cascade**:
1. **Local invasion**: Degradation of basement membrane and ECM
   - Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs)
   - Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)
2. **Intravasation**: Entry into blood or lymphatic vessels
3. **Survival in circulation**: Resist anoikis, immune attack
4. **Extravasation**: Exit from vessels at distant site
5. **Colonization**: Adapt to new microenvironment, resume proliferation

**Metastatic sites** (organ-specific tropism):
- Lung: Breast, kidney, colorectal, sarcoma
- Liver: Colorectal, pancreas, stomach, breast
- Bone: Breast, prostate, lung, kidney, thyroid
- Brain: Lung, breast, melanoma, kidney

**Seed and soil hypothesis**: Tumor cells (seed) preferentially grow in specific organs (soil) with favorable microenvironment

**Clinical significance**:
- Metastasis is leading cause of cancer death
- Stage IV disease generally incurable (exceptions: germ cell tumors, some lymphomas)

## Clinical Presentation

- Response to therapy

### Survival Metrics

**Overall survival (OS)**: Time from diagnosis/treatment to death (any cause)
**Progression-free survival (PFS)**: Time to disease progression or death

**5-year relative survival**: Percentage alive 5 years after diagnosis (compared to general population)

## Key Points

- Cancer is characterized by uncontrolled proliferation, invasion, and metastasis; carcinomas (epithelial origin) are most common (85-90%)
- Hallmarks of cancer include sustaining proliferative signaling, evading apoptosis, inducing angiogenesis, enabling replicative immortality, and activating invasion/metastasis
- Carcinogenesis is multi-step process (initiation → promotion → progression → metastasis); latency period is years to decades
- Oncogenes (KRAS, BRAF, HER2) promote growth via gain-of-function; tumor suppressors (TP53, RB, BRCA) inhibit growth via loss-of-function (two-hit hypothesis)
- TNM staging (Tumor, Nodes, Metastasis) is cornerstone of cancer staging; Stage I-II is localized, Stage III has regional nodes, Stage IV has distant metastasis
- Cancer screening reduces mortality: Mammography (breast), Pap/HPV (cervical), colonoscopy/FIT (colorectal), low-dose CT (lung in smokers), PSA (prostate, controversial)
- Treatment modalities include surgery (curative, palliative), radiation (curative, adjuvant, palliative), chemotherapy, targeted therapy, immunotherapy, hormonal therapy
- Neoadjuvant therapy given before surgery (downstage tumor); adjuvant therapy given after surgery (eliminate micrometastases)
