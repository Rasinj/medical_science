# Crystal Arthropathies

## Overview

Crystal arthropathies are a group of rheumatic diseases caused by the deposition of crystals in joints and periarticular tissues, leading to inflammation and arthritis. The two most common crystal arthropathies are gout (monosodium urate crystals) and calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease/CPPD (calcium pyrophosphate crystals, also called pseudogout). These conditions can present with acute painful arthritis as well as chronic joint damage.

## Gout

### Overview

Gout is the most common inflammatory arthritis in adults, caused by chronic hyperuricemia leading to monosodium urate (MSU) crystal deposition in joints and soft tissues. It classically presents as sudden-onset, severe pain and inflammation of the first metatarsophalangeal joint (podagra), though any joint can be affected. Gout is highly treatable with uric acid-lowering therapy, which can lead to crystal dissolution and disease resolution.

### Epidemiology

- Prevalence: 3-6% of adults in developed countries (increasing)
- Male-to-female ratio: 3-4:1 (equalizes after menopause)
- Age of onset: Men 30-50 years, women >60 years (postmenopausal)
- Increasing prevalence due to:
  - Obesity epidemic
  - Increased fructose consumption
  - Aging population
  - Chronic kidney disease
  - Diuretic use

### Pathophysiology

**Uric acid metabolism**:
- End product of purine metabolism
- Produced by xanthine oxidase
- 70% excreted by kidneys, 30% by GI tract
- Normal serum urate: <7 mg/dL (men), <6 mg/dL (women)
- Supersaturation occurs at >6.8 mg/dL → crystal formation

**Hyperuricemia mechanisms**:
- **Underexcretion** (90% of cases):
  - Reduced renal uric acid excretion
  - Genetic polymorphisms in urate transporters (URAT1, GLUT9)
  - Chronic kidney disease
  - Medications (diuretics, low-dose aspirin, cyclosporine)

- **Overproduction** (10%):
  - High-purine diet
  - Alcohol consumption (especially beer)
  - Tumor lysis syndrome
  - Myeloproliferative disorders
  - Psoriasis
  - Enzyme defects (HGPRT deficiency, PRPP synthetase overactivity)

**Crystal deposition**:
- MSU crystals deposit in joints, bursae, tendons (lower temperature favors deposition)
- Asymptomatic hyperuricemia for years before first flare
- Triggers: Trauma, illness, surgery, dietary indiscretion, rapid urate changes

**Inflammatory response**:
- MSU crystals activate NLRP3 inflammasome
- IL-1β release
- Neutrophil recruitment and activation
- Acute inflammatory arthritis
- Self-limited (days to weeks) due to resolution mechanisms

### Clinical Presentation

**Acute gout flare**:
- **Sudden onset** (often overnight)
- **Severe pain**: "Worst pain ever," cannot bear weight or touch
- **Monoarticular** in 90% of initial attacks
  - First MTP joint (podagra): 50-70% of first attacks, 90% lifetime
  - Other sites: Ankle, midfoot, knee, wrist, fingers
- **Inflammatory signs**: Intense erythema, swelling, warmth, exquisite tenderness
- **Systemic symptoms**: Fever (low-grade), malaise
- **Timing**: Often begins at night or early morning
- **Triggers**: Alcohol, purine-rich foods, dehydration, illness, surgery, trauma
- **Duration**: Untreated flares resolve in 7-14 days

**Intercritical gout**:
- Asymptomatic periods between flares
- Variable duration (months to years)
- Urate crystals remain in joints
- Second flare usually within 2 years

**Chronic tophaceous gout** (untreated for years):
- **Tophi**: Deposits of MSU crystals in soft tissues
  - Locations: Ears (helix), fingers, toes, elbows (olecranon bursa), Achilles tendon
  - Appear as firm, nodular masses
  - Can ulcerate and extrude chalky material
  - Painless unless infected or inflamed
- **Chronic gouty arthritis**:
  - Persistent pain and swelling
  - Joint damage and deformity
  - Polyarticular
  - Less inflammatory than acute flares
- Usually develops after 10-20 years of untreated gout
- Rare with modern urate-lowering therapy

**Extra-articular manifestations**:
- **Nephrolithiasis** (10-25%): Uric acid stones
- **Chronic kidney disease**: Urate nephropathy (debated)
- **Cardiovascular disease**: Associated with hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, obesity (metabolic syndrome)

### Diagnosis

**Clinical diagnosis** (classic presentation):
- Acute monoarticular arthritis
- First MTP involvement
- Hyperuricemia
- Rapid response to colchicine or NSAIDs

**Definitive diagnosis** (gold standard):
- **Synovial fluid analysis**:
  - **Polarized light microscopy**: Needle-shaped, negatively birefringent crystals (yellow when parallel to polarizer)
  - Intracellular crystals (in neutrophils) during acute flare
  - Extracellular crystals in intercritical periods
  - WBC count: Usually 2,000-100,000 (inflammatory range)
  - Gram stain and culture: Rule out septic arthritis (can coexist)

**Imaging**:
- **Conventional radiography**:
  - Normal in early disease
  - Chronic gout: Punched-out erosions with overhanging edges, preservation of joint space, soft tissue tophi
  - "Rat-bite" erosions

- **Ultrasound**:
  - **Double contour sign**: Hyperechoic enhancement over articular cartilage (MSU crystals on cartilage surface)
  - Tophi: Hyperechoic deposits with anechoic rim
  - Synovitis with power Doppler signal

- **Dual-energy CT (DECT)**:
  - Color-coded visualization of MSU crystals (green)
  - High sensitivity and specificity
  - Useful when arthrocentesis not feasible
  - Can detect subclinical deposits

**Laboratory**:
- **Serum urate**:
  - Elevated (>6.8 mg/dL) in 95% of gout patients overall
  - **Can be normal during acute flare** (30%): Inflammation causes uricosuria
  - Hyperuricemia alone does not equal gout (most people with hyperuricemia never develop gout)
  - Measure 2-4 weeks after flare resolves for accurate baseline

- **Inflammatory markers**:
  - ESR, CRP elevated during acute flare
  - WBC may be elevated

- **Renal function**: BUN, creatinine (many gout patients have CKD)

**Classification criteria** (2015 ACR/EULAR):
- **Entry criterion**: ≥1 episode of swelling, pain, or tenderness in peripheral joint/bursa
- **Sufficient criterion**: MSU crystals in symptomatic joint/bursa OR tophus
- **Scoring** (if crystals not demonstrated): Clinical, laboratory, imaging domains (score ≥8 = gout)

**Differential diagnosis**:
- **Septic arthritis**: Must rule out, can coexist with gout
- **Calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease** (pseudogout): Positively birefringent crystals
- **Cellulitis**: Overlying skin infection without joint involvement
- **Trauma**
- **Other inflammatory arthritis**: RA, reactive arthritis

### Treatment

**General principles**:
- Treat acute flares promptly
- Initiate urate-lowering therapy (ULT) for indications
- Treat-to-target: Goal serum urate <6 mg/dL (or <5 mg/dL if tophi)
- Lifestyle modifications
- Address cardiovascular risk factors

**Acute gout flare treatment**:

**First-line options** (start within 24 hours for best results):

1. **NSAIDs** (if no contraindication):
   - Indomethacin 50 mg TID (traditional, not superior to other NSAIDs)
   - Naproxen 500 mg BID
   - Ibuprofen 800 mg TID
   - Duration: Continue until flare resolves (usually 5-7 days)
   - Contraindications: Active PUD, CKD (GFR <30), recent MI, heart failure
   - PPI if GI risk factors

2. **Colchicine**:
   - **Low-dose regimen**: 1.2 mg x1, then 0.6 mg 1 hour later (total 1.8 mg day 1)
     - Then 0.6 mg once or twice daily until flare resolves
   - As effective as high-dose with fewer side effects
   - Most effective if started within 12-24 hours of flare onset
   - Side effects: Diarrhea (dose-dependent), nausea, abdominal pain
   - **Contraindications**: Severe renal or hepatic impairment, on P-glycoprotein or CYP3A4 inhibitors (clarithromycin, cyclosporine)
   - Dose reduction needed if CKD or drug interactions

3. **Glucocorticoids** (if NSAIDs and colchicine contraindicated):
   - **Intra-articular**: Triamcinolone 20-40 mg (monoarticular, very effective)
   - **Oral**: Prednisone 30-40 mg daily x 5-7 days (with or without taper)
   - **IV/IM**: Methylprednisolone 40-80 mg if unable to take PO
   - Comparable efficacy to NSAIDs
   - Preferred if renal impairment

**Refractory flares**:
- **IL-1 inhibitors** (off-label):
  - Anakinra 100 mg SC daily x3 days
  - Canakinumab 150 mg SC x1 (FDA-approved for frequent flares and ULT contraindicated)
  - Very effective but expensive

**Combination therapy**:
- NSAIDs + colchicine (if not contraindicated)
- May be more effective for severe flares

**Prophylaxis during urate-lowering therapy initiation**:
- Prevents flares triggered by urate fluctuation
- **Colchicine 0.6 mg daily or BID** (first-line)
- OR **Low-dose NSAIDs** (naproxen 250 mg BID)
- **Duration**: ≥3-6 months, until serum urate at target and no tophi

**Urate-lowering therapy (ULT)**:

**Indications** (2020 ACR guidelines):
- ≥2 flares per year
- Tophi
- Chronic kidney disease stage ≥2
- Urolithiasis
- Serum urate >9 mg/dL
- Some recommend after first flare in young patients

**Timing**: Can initiate during flare (with anti-inflammatory prophylaxis) or wait until flare resolves

**Target**: Serum urate <6 mg/dL (or <5 mg/dL if tophi present)

**First-line agents**:

1. **Xanthine oxidase inhibitors (XOI)**:

   **Allopurinol** (first-line):
   - Starting dose: 100 mg daily (50 mg if CKD stage ≥4)
   - Titrate by 100 mg every 2-4 weeks based on serum urate
   - Maximum: 800-900 mg daily (no renal dose cap)
   - Target dose to achieve urate <6 mg/dL (often requires >300 mg/day)
   - Side effects:
     - Rash (2%): Usually mild, discontinue if severe
     - **Allopurinol hypersensitivity syndrome** (rare, <1%):
       - Life-threatening: Rash, fever, eosinophilia, hepatitis, renal failure
       - Higher risk: HLA-B*5801 (screen in high-risk populations: Han Chinese, Korean, Thai)
       - Mortality 20-25%
   - Drug interactions: Azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine (reduce dose 75%)

   **Febuxostat**:
   - Starting dose: 40 mg daily
   - Titrate to 80 mg if urate not at goal (max 120 mg daily)
   - No renal dose adjustment needed (unless CKD stage 5)
   - More expensive than allopurinol
   - **FDA black box warning**: Cardiovascular death risk (especially if prior CV disease)
   - Use if allopurinol intolerant or contraindicated
   - Side effects: Elevated LFTs, rash, diarrhea

2. **Uricosuric agents** (second-line or add-on):

   **Probenecid**:
   - Dose: 500 mg BID, increase to 1000 mg BID if needed
   - Mechanism: Blocks URAT1 transporter, increases renal uric acid excretion
   - **Contraindications**: CKD (GFR <50), history of nephrolithiasis, uric acid overproducers
   - Adequate hydration required
   - Side effects: Rash, GI upset, nephrolithiasis
   - Less commonly used than XOI

   **Lesinurad**:
   - Dose: 200 mg daily (with XOI)
   - URAT1 inhibitor
   - Not available as monotherapy
   - Renal toxicity risk, require adequate hydration

**Refractory gout** (urate not at goal despite max XOI ± uricosuric):
- **Pegloticase** (PEGylated uricase):
  - IV infusion 8 mg every 2 weeks
  - Converts uric acid to allantoin (more soluble)
  - Very effective: Urate near 0, rapid tophus resolution
  - Reserved for severe refractory tophaceous gout
  - Side effects:
    - Infusion reactions (common)
    - Anaphylaxis (6-10%)
    - Antibody formation → loss of efficacy
  - Premedicate with antihistamines, steroids
  - Monitor urate levels (rising levels indicate antibody formation)
  - Immunomodulation (methotrexate, mycophenolate) may reduce antibody formation

**Lifestyle and dietary modifications**:
- **Effective**:
  - Weight loss (if overweight/obese)
  - Limit alcohol (especially beer and spirits)
  - Limit high-fructose corn syrup and sugary beverages
  - Adequate hydration
  - Avoid trigger medications if possible (diuretics, low-dose aspirin)
  - Exercise regularly

- **Modest benefit**:
  - Reduce high-purine foods: Organ meats, shellfish, red meat
  - Increase low-fat dairy products
  - Coffee consumption (may be protective)
  - Vitamin C supplementation (500-1500 mg daily)

- **Diet alone usually insufficient**: ULT usually required

**Treatment of asymptomatic hyperuricemia**:
- Generally NOT recommended
- Exception: Starting chemotherapy for hematologic malignancy (prevent tumor lysis)

**Monitoring ULT**:
- Serum urate every 2-4 weeks during dose titration
- Once at target, every 6-12 months
- Monitor renal function, LFTs periodically

### Complications

**Chronic gouty arthropathy**:
- Joint damage and deformity
- Preventable with ULT

**Tophi**:
- Disfigurement
- Joint destruction
- Nerve compression
- Skin ulceration and infection

**Nephrolithiasis**:
- Uric acid stones (radiolucent)
- Alkalinize urine (potassium citrate) if recurrent

**Cardiovascular disease**:
- Gout associated with hypertension, metabolic syndrome, CV events
- Treat CV risk factors aggressively

**Renal disease**:
- Gout and CKD often coexist
- ULT safe in CKD (dose-adjust allopurinol initiation, febuxostat no adjustment)

## Calcium Pyrophosphate Deposition Disease (CPPD)

### Overview

Calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease (CPPD) is caused by deposition of calcium pyrophosphate (CPP) crystals in cartilage and periarticular tissues. It can present as acute inflammatory arthritis (pseudogout), chronic arthritis mimicking osteoarthritis, or be asymptomatic (chondrocalcinosis on imaging). CPPD is primarily a disease of older adults and is associated with aging and metabolic conditions.

### Epidemiology

- Prevalence increases with age:
  - <60 years: <10%
  - 60-75 years: 15-20%
  - >80 years: 30-50%
- Equal sex distribution
- Most cases idiopathic (age-related)
- Familial forms (rare, autosomal dominant)

### Pathophysiology

**Crystal formation**:
- Abnormal pyrophosphate metabolism
- CPP crystals deposit in hyaline and fibrocartilage
- Chondrocalcinosis (calcification of cartilage)

**Risk factors and associations**:
- **Age**: Most important risk factor
- **Metabolic diseases** (screen in young patients with CPPD):
  - **Hyperparathyroidism**: Hypercalcemia
  - **Hemochromatosis**: Iron overload
  - **Hypothyroidism**
  - **Hypomagnesemia**
  - **Hypophosphatasia**: Low alkaline phosphatase
  - **Gitelman syndrome**: Renal magnesium wasting
- **Osteoarthritis**: CPPD accelerates OA
- **Trauma or surgery**: Can precipitate acute attacks

**Inflammatory response**:
- CPP crystals activate neutrophils
- Complement activation
- Cytokine release (IL-1, IL-6, TNF-α)
- Acute synovitis (pseudogout)

### Clinical Presentations

**1. Asymptomatic CPPD** (most common):
- Chondrocalcinosis found incidentally on imaging
- No symptoms
- No treatment needed

**2. Acute CPP crystal arthritis (pseudogout)**:
- Acute monoarticular or oligoarticular arthritis
- **Knee** most common (50%), also wrists, shoulders, ankles
- Sudden onset (hours to days)
- Severe pain, swelling, erythema, warmth
- Systemic symptoms: Fever, leukocytosis (can mimic sepsis)
- Self-limited (days to weeks)
- **Triggers**: Surgery, illness, trauma, hospitalization
- Mimics gout but:
  - Older patients
  - Different joints (knee > first MTP)
  - Less severe inflammation

**3. Chronic CPP crystal inflammatory arthritis**:
- Persistent polyarticular arthritis
- **Symmetric**, affects MCPs, wrists, knees
- Mimics rheumatoid arthritis ("pseudo-RA")
- Morning stiffness
- Can have acute flares superimposed

**4. Osteoarthritis with CPPD**:
- OA in unusual joints: MCPs, wrists, elbows, shoulders, ankles
- More severe and progressive than typical OA
- **Hemochromatosis arthropathy**: MCP joints, "hook" osteophytes on X-ray

**5. Crowned dens syndrome** (rare):
- Calcification of transverse ligament of C1
- Acute neck pain, stiffness, fever
- Elevated inflammatory markers
- Can mimic meningitis or polymyalgia rheumatica
- CT shows calcification around odontoid process

### Diagnosis

**Synovial fluid analysis** (gold standard):
- **Polarized light microscopy**: Rhomboid-shaped, positively birefringent crystals (blue when parallel to polarizer)
- Intracellular and extracellular
- WBC count: 2,000-100,000 (inflammatory)
- **Gram stain and culture**: Rule out septic arthritis

**Imaging**:
- **Radiography**:
  - **Chondrocalcinosis**: Linear or punctate calcification of cartilage
  - Common sites: Knee (menisci), wrist (triangular fibrocartilage), symphysis pubis, hip (labrum)
  - OA changes: Joint space narrowing, osteophytes, subchondral sclerosis
  - "Squared-off" bone ends (especially at 2nd and 3rd MCPs)

- **Ultrasound**:
  - Hyperechoic spots in hyaline cartilage
  - Less sensitive than radiography

- **CT**:
  - More sensitive for detecting calcification
  - Useful for axial skeleton (crowned dens syndrome)

**Laboratory**:
- CBC, CMP: Rule out metabolic associations
- **Screen for metabolic diseases** (if age <60 or family history):
  - Calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, alkaline phosphatase
  - PTH (hyperparathyroidism)
  - TSH, free T4 (hypothyroidism)
  - Ferritin, iron studies, transferrin saturation (hemochromatosis)
    - If elevated, HFE gene testing

**Differential diagnosis**:
- Gout: Negatively birefringent crystals
- Septic arthritis: Must rule out
- Rheumatoid arthritis: RF, anti-CCP positive, symmetric small joint polyarthritis
- Osteoarthritis: Mechanical pain, no acute flares

### Treatment

**Acute CPP crystal arthritis**:
- Same as acute gout treatment
- **NSAIDs** (first-line): Indomethacin 50 mg TID, naproxen 500 mg BID
- **Colchicine**: 1.2 mg x1, then 0.6 mg 1 hour later
- **Glucocorticoids**:
  - Intra-articular: Very effective for monoarthritis
  - Systemic: Prednisone 30-40 mg daily x 5-7 days
- **IL-1 inhibitors**: Anakinra, canakinumab (if refractory, off-label)

**Chronic CPP crystal inflammatory arthritis**:
- **NSAIDs**: As needed for symptoms
- **Colchicine**: 0.6 mg daily or BID (prophylaxis against flares)
- **Low-dose glucocorticoids**: Prednisone ≤7.5 mg daily
- **DMARDs** (if pseudo-RA pattern):
  - Methotrexate 15-25 mg weekly
  - Hydroxychloroquine 200-400 mg daily
  - Limited evidence for DMARDs in CPPD
- **IL-1 inhibitors**: Anakinra (case reports, off-label)

**Osteoarthritis with CPPD**:
- Treat as osteoarthritis
- Acetaminophen, NSAIDs, intra-articular corticosteroids
- Physical therapy
- Joint replacement if end-stage

**No disease-modifying therapy**:
- Unlike gout, no treatment to dissolve CPP crystals
- Cannot reverse chondrocalcinosis

**Treat underlying metabolic disease**:
- Hyperparathyroidism: Parathyroidectomy
- Hemochromatosis: Phlebotomy, iron chelation
- Hypothyroidism: Levothyroxine
- Hypomagnesemia: Magnesium supplementation
- Treating underlying disease does not reverse CPPD but may slow progression

### Prognosis

- Variable course
- Acute pseudogout: Self-limited, recurrent attacks
- Chronic CPPD arthritis: Progressive joint damage
- No specific therapy to prevent crystal deposition
- Asymptomatic chondrocalcinosis: No treatment needed, may never become symptomatic

## Calcium Hydroxyapatite Deposition Disease

### Overview

- Deposition of calcium hydroxyapatite crystals
- **Calcific tendinitis/periarthritis**: Shoulder (supraspinatus tendon) most common
- **Milwaukee shoulder syndrome**: Destructive arthritis of shoulder with large effusion
- Crystals not visible on light microscopy (require electron microscopy or special stains)

### Clinical Presentation

**Calcific tendinitis**:
- Acute severe shoulder pain (often nocturnal)
- Restricted range of motion
- Exquisite tenderness
- X-ray: Calcific deposit in tendon (rotator cuff)
- Self-limited (weeks to months)

**Milwaukee shoulder syndrome**:
- Elderly women
- Chronic shoulder pain and swelling
- Large effusion (often bloody)
- Rapid destructive arthropathy
- "Cuff tear arthropathy"

### Treatment

**Acute calcific tendinitis**:
- NSAIDs, ice
- Intra-articular or subacromial corticosteroid injection
- US-guided aspiration and lavage of calcific deposit
- Refractory: Surgical excision, shockwave therapy

**Milwaukee shoulder syndrome**:
- NSAIDs, corticosteroid injections
- Often requires shoulder arthroplasty

## Prognosis

### Gout
- Excellent prognosis with treat-to-target ULT
- Serum urate <6 mg/dL leads to crystal dissolution
- Tophi can resolve over months to years
- Prevention of flares and joint damage
- Requires lifelong ULT adherence
- Increased CV and renal disease risk

### CPPD
- Variable prognosis
- No disease-modifying therapy
- Asymptomatic chondrocalcinosis: May never cause symptoms
- Acute pseudogout: Recurrent attacks
- Chronic CPPD arthritis: Progressive joint damage
- OA with CPPD: More severe, unusual distribution

## Key Points

- Gout is caused by MSU crystal deposition from chronic hyperuricemia; presents as acute severe monoarticular arthritis (often first MTP)
- Definitive diagnosis requires synovial fluid analysis showing needle-shaped negatively birefringent crystals
- Acute gout treatment: NSAIDs, colchicine, or corticosteroids; start within 24 hours of flare onset for best results
- Urate-lowering therapy (allopurinol first-line) indicated for ≥2 flares/year, tophi, CKD, urolithiasis; target serum urate <6 mg/dL
- Prophylaxis with colchicine 0.6 mg daily during ULT initiation for ≥3-6 months to prevent flares
- CPPD presents as acute pseudogout (knee most common), chronic arthritis, or asymptomatic chondrocalcinosis on imaging
- CPP crystals are rhomboid-shaped and positively birefringent; treat acute pseudogout same as gout
- No disease-modifying therapy for CPPD (cannot dissolve crystals); screen for metabolic diseases (hyperparathyroidism, hemochromatosis) in young patients
