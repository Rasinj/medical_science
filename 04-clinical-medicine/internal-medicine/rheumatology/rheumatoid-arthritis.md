# Rheumatoid Arthritis

## Overview

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, systemic autoimmune disease characterized by symmetric inflammatory polyarthritis that primarily affects the small joints of the hands and feet. Left untreated, RA leads to progressive joint destruction, deformity, disability, and increased mortality. RA affects approximately 0.5-1% of adults worldwide, with a 3:1 female predominance. Early diagnosis and aggressive treatment with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) can prevent irreversible joint damage and improve long-term outcomes.

### Epidemiology

- Prevalence: 0.5-1% of adults globally
- Female-to-male ratio: 3:1
- Peak age of onset: 40-60 years
- Can occur at any age (juvenile idiopathic arthritis in children)
- Genetic component: 50-60% heritability
- Environmental risk factors: Smoking (strongest modifiable risk factor), periodontal disease, silica exposure
- Higher prevalence in certain ethnicities (Pima Indians, Chippewa Indians)

### Economic Burden

- Leading cause of work disability
- Reduced quality of life
- Increased healthcare costs ($19 billion annually in US)
- Indirect costs from work loss exceed direct medical costs
- Early aggressive treatment reduces long-term disability and costs

## Pathophysiology

### Immunologic Mechanisms

**Initiation phase**:
- Environmental triggers (smoking, infection, microbiome dysbiosis) in genetically susceptible individuals
- Post-translational modification of proteins (citrullination)
- Loss of immune tolerance to citrullinated proteins
- T cell activation and B cell differentiation

**Propagation phase**:
- Autoantibody production: Rheumatoid factor (RF), anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPA)
- Immune complex formation and complement activation
- Cytokine release: TNF-α, IL-1, IL-6, IL-17
- Recruitment of inflammatory cells to synovium
- Synovial hyperplasia and pannus formation

**Tissue damage phase**:
- Pannus invasion of cartilage and bone
- Osteoclast activation and bone erosion
- Chondrocyte death and cartilage destruction
- Fibrosis and joint deformity

### Genetic Factors

**HLA associations**:
- HLA-DRB1*04 (shared epitope): 4-5 fold increased risk
- Strongest genetic risk factor
- Associated with ACPA-positive RA
- Predicts more severe disease

**Non-HLA genes**:
- PTPN22: Lymphocyte signaling
- STAT4: Cytokine signaling
- CTLA4: T cell regulation
- PADI4: Peptidyl arginine deiminase (citrullination enzyme)

### Environmental Factors

**Smoking**:
- Strongest environmental risk factor
- Increases risk 2-fold
- Induces citrullination in lungs
- Gene-environment interaction (HLA-DRB1 + smoking)
- Predicts worse prognosis
- Associated with ACPA-positive RA

**Other factors**:
- Periodontal disease (Porphyromonas gingivalis produces citrullinating enzyme)
- Gut dysbiosis
- Silica exposure
- Obesity
- Hormonal factors (protective effect of pregnancy, OCP use controversial)

## Diagnosis

### Clinical Assessment

**History**:
- Joint symptoms: Location, pattern, duration, morning stiffness
- Functional impairment
- Constitutional symptoms
- Family history of RA or other autoimmune diseases
- Smoking history
- Occupational exposures

**Physical examination**:
- 28-joint examination for tenderness and swelling
- Assessment for deformities
- Extra-articular manifestations

### Laboratory Tests

**Autoantibodies**:
- **Rheumatoid factor (RF)**:
  - Sensitivity: 70-80%
  - Specificity: 85% (lower in elderly)
  - Can be positive in other conditions: SLE, Sjögren's, cryoglobulinemia, chronic infections, elderly
  - Titer correlates with disease severity and extra-articular manifestations

- **Anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP, ACPA)**:
  - Sensitivity: 70-80%
  - Specificity: 95-98% (more specific than RF)
  - Can be positive years before symptom onset
  - Predicts more aggressive disease and radiographic progression
  - Preferred over RF for specificity

- **Both RF and anti-CCP positive**: Very high specificity (>99%) for RA

- **Seronegative RA**: RF and anti-CCP negative (15-20% of patients)
  - Usually milder disease
  - May test positive later in disease course

**Inflammatory markers**:
- **ESR**: Elevated in active disease
- **CRP**: More specific for inflammation, rises and falls faster than ESR
- Normal levels don't exclude RA
- Useful for monitoring disease activity

**Other tests**:
- CBC: Anemia (chronic disease, NSAID-related GI bleed), thrombocytosis
- CMP: Baseline renal and liver function before DMARDs
- Urinalysis: Proteinuria (rare glomerulonephritis, NSAID-related)

### Imaging

**Radiography (X-rays)**:
- **Early changes** (first 2 years):
  - Soft tissue swelling
  - Periarticular osteopenia (juxta-articular bone loss)

- **Progressive changes**:
  - Joint space narrowing (uniform, concentric)
  - Marginal erosions (breaks in cortical bone at joint margins)
  - Subluxation and malalignment

- **Standard views**: Hands (PA), feet (AP), other involved joints
- **Larsen score** or **Sharp-van der Heijde score**: Quantify radiographic damage

**Ultrasound**:
- Detects synovitis (synovial hypertrophy, effusion)
- Power Doppler: Active inflammation
- Erosions (more sensitive than X-ray)
- Tenosynovitis
- Useful for guiding joint injections

**MRI**:
- Most sensitive for early erosions and bone marrow edema
- Synovitis and tenosynovitis
- Predicts radiographic progression
- Expensive, not routinely used

- Crystalline arthropathies (gout, pseudogout)

## Treatment

### General Principles

**Goals**:
- Achieve remission or low disease activity
- Prevent joint damage
- Maintain function and quality of life
- Minimize drug toxicity

**Treat-to-target strategy**:
- Set specific disease activity target (remission or low disease activity)
- Assess disease activity every 1-3 months
- Escalate therapy if target not met within 3-6 months
- Use validated measures: DAS28, CDAI, SDAI

**Early aggressive therapy**:
- Start DMARDs within 3 months of symptom onset (ideally within 6 weeks)
- "Window of opportunity": Early treatment prevents irreversible damage
- Poor prognostic factors warrant more aggressive initial therapy

### Disease Activity Measures

**Disease Activity Score-28 (DAS28)**:
- Assesses 28 joints (tender and swollen)
- Includes ESR or CRP
- Patient global assessment
- Score: Remission <2.6, Low 2.6-3.2, Moderate 3.2-5.1, High >5.1

**Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI)**:
- Sum of tender joint count, swollen joint count, patient global, physician global
- Score: Remission ≤2.8, Low 2.8-10, Moderate 10-22, High >22

**Simplified Disease Activity Index (SDAI)**:
- CDAI + CRP
- Score: Remission ≤3.3, Low 3.3-11, Moderate 11-26, High >26

### Pharmacologic Therapy

**NSAIDs and COX-2 inhibitors**:
- Symptom relief only, do not prevent progression
- Use lowest effective dose for shortest duration
- Monitor for GI, renal, cardiovascular side effects
- PPI for GI prophylaxis if risk factors

**Glucocorticoids**:
- Rapid symptom relief
- Bridge therapy while awaiting DMARD effect
- Low-dose prednisone ≤7.5 mg/day
- Intra-articular injections for monoarticular flares
- Taper to discontinue as DMARDs take effect
- Avoid chronic high-dose use (osteoporosis, infections, CV disease)

**Conventional synthetic DMARDs (csDMARDs)**:

1. **Methotrexate** (first-line):
   - Dose: 7.5-25 mg weekly (oral or subcutaneous)
   - Mechanism: Folate antagonist, anti-inflammatory
   - Give folic acid 1 mg daily or 5 mg weekly (not on MTX day)
   - Efficacy: 60-70% ACR20 response
   - Onset: 6-8 weeks, maximal effect 3-6 months
   - **Monitoring**:
     - CBC, CMP, LFTs every 2-4 weeks initially, then every 8-12 weeks
     - Chest X-ray at baseline (ILD screening)
   - **Side effects**:
     - GI: Nausea (most common, improved with folic acid or SC route)
     - Hepatotoxicity: Transient transaminase elevation (dose-reduce or discontinue if persistent >3x ULN)
     - Bone marrow suppression: Monitor CBC
     - Pulmonary toxicity: Pneumonitis (rare, 1%)
     - Teratogenic: Contraception required, discontinue 3 months before conception
   - **Contraindications**: Pregnancy, significant liver disease, alcohol abuse, chronic kidney disease (CrCl <30)

2. **Hydroxychloroquine**:
   - Dose: 200-400 mg daily (≤5 mg/kg ideal body weight)

   - Low toxicity profile
   - **Monitoring**: Ophthalmologic exam at baseline, annually after 5 years (retinal toxicity)
   - Efficacy: Modest, often insufficient as monotherapy
   - Safe in pregnancy

3. **Sulfasalazine**:
   - Dose: 500 mg daily, increase to 2-3 g daily in divided doses
   - **Side effects**: GI upset, rash, cytopenias, oligospermia (reversible)
   - **Monitoring**: CBC every 2-4 weeks for 3 months, then every 3 months
   - Less effective than methotrexate

4. **Leflunomide**:
   - Dose: Loading 100 mg daily x3 days (optional), then 10-20 mg daily
   - Mechanism: Pyrimidine synthesis inhibition
   - Similar efficacy to methotrexate
   - **Side effects**: Diarrhea, hepatotoxicity, alopecia, hypertension
   - **Monitoring**: CBC, LFTs every 4-8 weeks
   - Teratogenic, very long half-life (washout with cholestyramine if needed)
   - Alternative to methotrexate if intolerant

**Triple therapy (csDMARD combination)**:
- Methotrexate + hydroxychloroquine + sulfasalazine
- More effective than methotrexate alone
- Used before advancing to biologics

**Biologic DMARDs (bDMARDs)**:

**Indications**:
- Inadequate response to methotrexate monotherapy
- Poor prognostic factors at diagnosis (high-titer RF/ACPA, erosions, extra-articular manifestations)
- Usually combined with methotrexate (superior to monotherapy)

**TNF inhibitors** (first-line biologics):
- **Adalimumab**: 40 mg SC every 2 weeks
- **Etanercept**: 50 mg SC weekly
- **Infliximab**: 3-10 mg/kg IV at 0, 2, 6 weeks, then every 8 weeks
- **Golimumab**: 50 mg SC monthly or 2 mg/kg IV every 8 weeks
- **Certolizumab**: 200 mg SC every 2 weeks or 400 mg every 4 weeks

- Efficacy: 60-70% ACR20, 40-50% ACR50

  - Demyelinating disease: Avoid if history of MS
  - Lupus-like syndrome: Rare
  - Malignancy: Controversial (possibly increased lymphoma, skin cancer)
- **Loss of response**: Switch to different TNF inhibitor or different class

**Non-TNF biologics**:

- **Abatacept** (CTLA4-Ig, T cell costimulation blocker):
  - 500-1000 mg IV monthly or 125 mg SC weekly
  - Efficacy similar to TNF inhibitors
  - May be preferred if prior serious infections
  - Avoid live vaccines

- **Rituximab** (anti-CD20, B cell depletion):
  - 1000 mg IV on days 0 and 14, repeat every 6-12 months
  - Efficacy: 50-60% ACR20
  - Preferred if contraindication to TNF inhibitors or lymphoma history
  - Screen for hepatitis B (reactivation risk)

  - Lipid elevation: Monitor lipids
  - Cytopenias: Monitor CBC
  - Thrombosis: Increased risk of VTE, arterial thrombosis (especially tofacitinib 10 mg BID)
  - GI perforation (rare)
- **Monitoring**: CBC, LFTs, lipids, creatinine every 3 months
- **Screening**: TB, hepatitis B and C (as for biologics)

**Treatment algorithm**:
1. Start methotrexate ± short-term low-dose prednisone
2. If inadequate response at 3 months: Add or switch csDMARD (triple therapy or leflunomide)
3. If still inadequate at 6 months: Add bDMARD (TNF inhibitor) or tsDMARD
4. If inadequate response to first biologic: Switch to different TNF inhibitor or different mechanism (abatacept, rituximab, tocilizumab, JAK inhibitor)

**Biosimilars**:
- Lower-cost alternatives to originator biologics
- Similar efficacy and safety
- FDA-approved biosimilars available for infliximab, adalimumab, etanercept, rituximab

### Vaccination

**Recommendations**:
- **Before starting immunosuppression**:
  - Pneumococcal: PCV20 or PCV15 followed by PPSV23
  - Influenza: Annual inactivated vaccine
  - Hepatitis B: If at risk
  - Herpes zoster: Recombinant vaccine (Shingrix) preferred over live vaccine

- **Avoid live vaccines** on biologics or JAK inhibitors:
  - MMR, varicella, live zoster (Zostavax), live intranasal influenza
  - Can give if necessary: Discontinue biologics 1-3 months before, restart 4 weeks after

### Surgery

**Perioperative DMARD management**:
- **Continue**: Methotrexate, hydroxychloroquine, sulfasalazine, leflunomide
- **Hold biologics**: 1 dosing interval before surgery, resume when wound healed (7-14 days)
- **JAK inhibitors**: Hold 3 days before, resume when wound healed
- **Stress-dose steroids** if on chronic glucocorticoids

**Orthopedic surgery**:
- Joint replacement for end-stage arthritis
- Tendon repair for rupture
- Synovectomy (less common with modern therapy)
- Cervical spine stabilization for atlantoaxial instability

### Monitoring

**Disease activity**: Every 1-3 months until target achieved, then every 3-6 months
**Laboratory monitoring** (while on DMARDs):
- CBC, CMP, LFTs every 8-12 weeks (more frequent initially)
- Urinalysis periodically
**Radiographs**: Hands and feet at baseline, then annually or if clinical progression
**Extra-articular screening**:
- Lipids, cardiovascular risk assessment
- DEXA scan for osteoporosis (baseline, repeat per guidelines)
- ILD screening if risk factors (CXR or HRCT, PFTs)

## Complications

### Joint Complications
- Erosive arthritis and deformities
- Joint subluxation and instability
- Tendon rupture
- Cervical spine involvement: Atlantoaxial subluxation, spinal stenosis, myelopathy
- Septic arthritis (increased risk on immunosuppression)

### Extra-Articular Complications
- Interstitial lung disease
- Cardiovascular disease (accelerated atherosclerosis)
- Infections (immunosuppression-related)
- Lymphoma
- Osteoporosis and fragility fractures
- Amyloidosis (rare with modern therapy)

### Treatment-Related Complications

- Biologics: Infections (TB, fungal, bacterial), infusion reactions
- JAK inhibitors: Herpes zoster, thrombosis, cytopenias
- Glucocorticoids: Osteoporosis, diabetes, hypertension, weight gain, infections, adrenal suppression

## Prognosis

### Natural History (Untreated)
- Progressive joint destruction over years
- 50% work disabled within 10 years
- Reduced life expectancy by 3-7 years
- Increased mortality from cardiovascular disease and infections

### With Modern Therapy
- 50-60% achieve remission or low disease activity
- Significant reduction in radiographic progression
- Improved functional outcomes
- Sustained remission in 20-30% allowing treatment de-escalation
- Mortality gap narrowing with aggressive treatment

### Prognostic Factors

**Poor prognosis**:
- High-titer RF and anti-CCP
- Elevated inflammatory markers
- Early erosions on imaging
- HLA-DRB1 shared epitope
- Smoking
- Extra-articular manifestations
- High disease activity at presentation
- Female sex
- Lower socioeconomic status

**Good prognosis**:
- Seronegative disease
- Early treatment initiation
- Achieving early remission
- No erosions at 1 year

### Special Populations

**Pregnancy**:
- RA often improves during pregnancy (70-80%)
- Flares common postpartum
- Safe medications: Hydroxychloroquine, sulfasalazine, prednisone, TNF inhibitors (most)
- Contraindicated: Methotrexate, leflunomide
- JAK inhibitors: Limited data, generally avoid

**Elderly**:
- Late-onset RA (>60 years): More acute onset, larger joints, higher ESR
- Increased comorbidities
- Lower doses of DMARDs may be needed
- Increased infection risk

## Key Points

- Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory polyarthritis affecting small joints symmetrically with morning stiffness >60 minutes
- RF and anti-CCP antibodies are diagnostic; both positive has >99% specificity; anti-CCP predicts more aggressive disease
- Early aggressive treatment with methotrexate-based regimen within 3 months of symptom onset prevents irreversible joint damage
- Treat-to-target strategy with regular monitoring and therapy escalation achieves remission or low disease activity in 50-60% of patients
- TNF inhibitors, non-TNF biologics, and JAK inhibitors are highly effective for methotrexate-inadequate responders
- Screen for TB and hepatitis B before starting biologic or JAK inhibitor therapy
- Extra-articular manifestations include ILD, accelerated atherosclerosis, and increased infection risk
- RA increases cardiovascular mortality; aggressive CV risk factor modification is essential
