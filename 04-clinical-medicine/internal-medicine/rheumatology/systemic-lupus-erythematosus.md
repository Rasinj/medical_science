# Systemic Lupus Erythematosus

## Overview

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic, multisystem autoimmune disease characterized by periods of flares and remissions. It is caused by the production of autoantibodies and immune complexes that lead to inflammation and tissue damage in multiple organs, including skin, joints, kidneys, heart, lungs, and central nervous system. SLE predominantly affects women of childbearing age and has significant racial and ethnic disparities in incidence and severity.

### Epidemiology

- Prevalence: 20-150 per 100,000 population (varies by ethnicity and geography)
- Female-to-male ratio: 9:1 (women of childbearing age)
- Age of onset: Typically 15-45 years (peak in 20s-30s)
- Racial disparities:
  - African Americans: 3-4 fold higher incidence than Caucasians
  - Hispanics, Asians, Native Americans: 2-3 fold higher incidence
  - More severe disease in non-Caucasian populations
- Childhood-onset SLE: 10-20% of cases, more severe
- Late-onset SLE (>50 years): 10-20%, less severe

### Economic and Social Impact

- Significant morbidity and reduced quality of life
- High healthcare costs ($20,000-$40,000 annually per patient)
- Work disability in 40-50% within 10 years
- Reduced life expectancy: 80-90% of general population
- Bimodal mortality: Early (infections, active disease), late (cardiovascular disease)

## Pathophysiology

### Immune Dysregulation

**Loss of immune tolerance**:
- Defective clearance of apoptotic cells
- Exposure of nuclear antigens
- Impaired B cell and T cell regulation
- Loss of tolerance to self-antigens

**B cell abnormalities**:
- Hyperactive B cells producing autoantibodies
- Decreased B cell apoptosis
- Expansion of autoreactive B cell clones

**T cell abnormalities**:
- Altered T cell signaling
- Decreased regulatory T cells (Tregs)
- Th1/Th2 imbalance
- T cell help for B cell autoantibody production

### Autoantibody Production

**Antinuclear antibodies (ANA)**:
- Present in 95-98% of SLE patients
- Highly sensitive but not specific (positive in many other conditions and 5-10% of healthy individuals)
- Pattern and titer less important than specific antibodies

**Specific autoantibodies**:
- **Anti-dsDNA**: 60-70% of SLE patients, 95-98% specificity
  - Fluctuates with disease activity (especially nephritis)
  - Pathogenic (forms immune complexes)
- **Anti-Smith (Sm)**: 25-30% sensitivity, >99% specificity
  - Most specific for SLE
  - Does not correlate with disease activity
- **Anti-Ro/SSA**: 30-40% of SLE
  - Associated with photosensitivity, subacute cutaneous lupus, neonatal lupus
- **Anti-La/SSB**: 10-15% of SLE
  - Usually with anti-Ro, associated with Sjögren's syndrome
- **Anti-RNP**: 30-40% of SLE
  - High titer in mixed connective tissue disease
- **Anti-histone**: 70% of drug-induced lupus, 50% of SLE
- **Antiphospholipid antibodies**: 30-40% of SLE
  - Lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin, anti-β2-glycoprotein I
  - Associated with thrombosis and pregnancy complications

### Immune Complex Formation

**Pathogenic mechanisms**:
- Immune complex deposition in tissues (kidneys, skin, joints)
- Complement activation
- Neutrophil recruitment
- Cytokine release (Type I interferon, TNF-α, IL-6, IL-10)
- Tissue inflammation and damage

**Type I interferon signature**:
- Elevated interferon-α in SLE
- Drives autoantibody production
- Promotes inflammation
- Therapeutic target

### Genetic Factors

**HLA associations**:
- HLA-DR2 and HLA-DR3: Increased risk
- HLA-DRB1*0301: Association with anti-Ro/La

**Complement deficiencies**:
- C1q, C2, C4 deficiency: Strong association with SLE
- Impaired clearance of immune complexes and apoptotic cells

**Other genes**:
- FCGR2A, FCGR3A: Fc receptor polymorphisms
- STAT4, IRF5: Interferon pathway
- PTPN22: T cell signaling

### Environmental Triggers

- **UV light**: Triggers flares, causes apoptosis and autoantigen exposure
- **Infections**: Epstein-Barr virus (molecular mimicry)
- **Medications**: Procainamide, hydralazine, isoniazid, minocycline, anti-TNF agents (drug-induced lupus)
- **Hormones**: Estrogen may influence disease (higher in women of childbearing age)
- **Smoking**: Associated with cutaneous lupus and anti-dsDNA

- Malignancy (5-10%)

### Morbidity
- Irreversible organ damage accumulates over time
- Corticosteroids contribute significantly to damage (osteoporosis, cataracts, AVN, CVD)
- Early aggressive treatment with steroid-sparing agents reduces damage

### Prognostic Factors

**Poor prognosis**:
- Lupus nephritis (especially class IV)
- Neuropsychiatric SLE
- Antiphospholipid syndrome with thrombosis
- Low socioeconomic status
- African American, Hispanic ethnicity
- Male sex
- Childhood-onset SLE

**Good prognosis**:
- Cutaneous and musculoskeletal disease only
- Early treatment
- Good adherence
- Access to specialized care

## Key Points

- SLE is a multisystem autoimmune disease with highly variable presentation and course, predominantly affecting women of childbearing age
- ANA is highly sensitive (95-98%) screening test; anti-dsDNA and anti-Smith are highly specific; complement levels track disease activity
- Lupus nephritis occurs in 40-50% and requires renal biopsy for classification; class III-IV requires aggressive immunosuppression with mycophenolate or cyclophosphamide
- Hydroxychloroquine should be used in all SLE patients unless contraindicated; reduces flares, damage, and mortality
- Minimize corticosteroid exposure by using steroid-sparing immunosuppressants (methotrexate, azathioprine, mycophenolate) and biologics (belimumab, rituximab)
- Cardiovascular disease is major cause of late mortality; aggressive CV risk factor modification essential
- SLE pregnancy is high-risk; requires preconception counseling, quiescent disease for 6 months, and MFM co-management
- Antiphospholipid syndrome in SLE requires lifelong anticoagulation with warfarin if thrombosis history
