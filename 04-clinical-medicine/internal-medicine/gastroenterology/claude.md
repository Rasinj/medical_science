# Gastroenterology

## Overview

Gastroenterology is the medical specialty focused on the digestive system and its disorders, encompassing the gastrointestinal tract from the esophagus to the rectum, as well as the accessory organs including the liver, gallbladder, and pancreas. Gastrointestinal diseases affect millions worldwide and range from functional disorders to life-threatening malignancies.

### Scope of Gastroenterology

**Upper GI tract**:
- Esophageal disorders: GERD, esophagitis, achalasia, esophageal cancer
- Gastric disorders: Peptic ulcer disease, gastritis, gastric cancer
- Duodenal disorders: Duodenal ulcers, celiac disease

**Lower GI tract**:
- Small intestine: Malabsorption, Crohn's disease, small bowel tumors
- Colon and rectum: Inflammatory bowel disease, diverticular disease, colorectal cancer, irritable bowel syndrome
- Anus: Hemorrhoids, anal fissures, fistulas

**Hepatobiliary**:
- Liver: Viral hepatitis, cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, fatty liver disease
- Gallbladder: Cholelithiasis, cholecystitis, biliary dyskinesia
- Bile ducts: Cholangitis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, cholangiocarcinoma

- GERD: Affects 20% of Western populations

**Economic impact**:
- GI diseases cost >$100 billion annually in United States
- Leading cause of hospitalizations
- Significant impact on quality of life and productivity

## Gastrointestinal Anatomy and Physiology

### Esophagus
- Muscular tube connecting pharynx to stomach (~25 cm)
- Upper 1/3: Striated muscle; Lower 2/3: Smooth muscle
- Upper esophageal sphincter (UES): Prevents air entry
- Lower esophageal sphincter (LES): Prevents reflux (pressure 10-30 mmHg)
- Peristalsis: Primary (initiated by swallow) and secondary (response to distension)

### Stomach
- Fundus, body, antrum, pylorus
- Secretory functions:
  - Parietal cells: HCl and intrinsic factor
  - Chief cells: Pepsinogen
  - G cells: Gastrin
  - Mucous cells: Protective mucus and bicarbonate
- Gastric acid: pH 1-2, activates pepsinogen, kills bacteria
- Intrinsic factor: Vitamin B12 absorption

### Small Intestine
- **Duodenum** (25 cm): Receives bile and pancreatic secretions
- **Jejunum** (2.5 m): Primary site of nutrient absorption
- **Ileum** (3.5 m): B12 and bile acid absorption
- Villi and microvilli increase surface area 600-fold
- Brush border enzymes: Final carbohydrate and protein digestion
- Absorption: Nutrients, water, electrolytes

### Colon
- Cecum, ascending, transverse, descending, sigmoid, rectum (~1.5 m)
- Functions:
  - Water and electrolyte absorption
  - Bacterial fermentation of undigested carbohydrates
  - Storage and elimination of waste
- Colonic microbiome: 10¹⁴ bacteria, essential for health

### Liver
- Largest internal organ (1.5 kg)
- Dual blood supply: Portal vein (75%) and hepatic artery (25%)
- Functions:
  - Protein synthesis: Albumin, clotting factors
  - Carbohydrate metabolism: Gluconeogenesis, glycogen storage
  - Lipid metabolism: Cholesterol synthesis, lipoprotein production
  - Bile production: 500-1000 mL/day
  - Detoxification: Drugs, ammonia, bilirubin
  - Immune function: Kupffer cells

### Pancreas
- **Exocrine** (98%): Acinar cells produce digestive enzymes
  - Amylase: Carbohydrate digestion
  - Lipase: Fat digestion
  - Proteases: Protein digestion (trypsin, chymotrypsin)
- **Endocrine** (2%): Islets of Langerhans
  - Insulin, glucagon, somatostatin
- Pancreatic duct joins common bile duct at ampulla of Vater

## Diagnostic Modalities

### Endoscopy

**Upper endoscopy (EGD)**:
- Visualizes esophagus, stomach, duodenum
- Indications: Dyspepsia, GERD, GI bleeding, dysphagia, anemia
- Capabilities: Biopsy, hemostasis, dilation, foreign body removal
- Complications: Perforation (<0.1%), bleeding, aspiration

**Colonoscopy**:
- Visualizes entire colon and terminal ileum
- Indications: Screening (age ≥45), bleeding, diarrhea, IBD surveillance
- Polypectomy: Remove polyps, prevent cancer
- Complications: Perforation (0.1%), bleeding (0.1-0.6%), post-polypectomy syndrome

**Flexible sigmoidoscopy**:
- Visualizes rectum and distal colon
- Screening alternative to colonoscopy
- Lower risk than colonoscopy

**Capsule endoscopy**:
- Wireless camera pill, visualizes small bowel
- Indications: Obscure GI bleeding, Crohn's disease assessment
- Contraindication: Stricture (capsule retention risk)

**Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)**:
- Combines endoscopy with ultrasound
- Applications: Pancreatic/biliary disease staging, FNA of masses

**ERCP** (Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography):
- Therapeutic procedure for biliary/pancreatic disease
- Stone extraction, stent placement, sphincterotomy
- Complications: Pancreatitis (3-5%), bleeding, perforation

### Imaging

**Abdominal X-ray**:
- Bowel obstruction, perforation (free air), constipation
- Limited sensitivity for most GI conditions

**Ultrasound**:
- First-line for hepatobiliary disease
- Detects gallstones, biliary dilation, liver masses
- Advantages: No radiation, real-time, inexpensive

**CT scan**:
- Detailed cross-sectional imaging
- Applications: Acute abdomen, staging malignancy, IBD complications
- CT enterography: Small bowel imaging
- Contrast-enhanced for vascular assessment

**MRI/MRCP**:
- Excellent soft tissue contrast

- Liver MRI: Characterize lesions, assess fibrosis (elastography)

**Barium studies**:
- Less common with advent of CT/MRI
- Barium swallow: Esophageal structure and function
- Upper GI series: Stomach and small bowel
- Barium enema: Colon (largely replaced by colonoscopy)

### Laboratory Tests

**Liver function tests**:
- **AST/ALT**: Hepatocellular injury (ALT more specific)
- **Alkaline phosphatase**: Cholestasis, bone disease
- **Bilirubin**: Direct (conjugated) vs. indirect (unconjugated)
- **Albumin**: Synthetic function
- **PT/INR**: Synthetic function, vitamin K status
- **GGT**: Confirms hepatic source of elevated ALP

**Pancreatic enzymes**:
- Amylase and lipase: Elevated in pancreatitis (lipase more specific)

**Tumor markers**:

- AFP: Hepatocellular carcinoma

**Stool studies**:
- Fecal occult blood: Screening for colorectal cancer
- Fecal calprotectin: IBD vs. IBS differentiation
- Stool culture: Infectious diarrhea
- C. difficile toxin: Pseudomembranous colitis
- Fecal elastase: Pancreatic insufficiency
