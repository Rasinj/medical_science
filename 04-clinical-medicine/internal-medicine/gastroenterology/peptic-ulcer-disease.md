# Peptic Ulcer Disease

## Overview

Peptic ulcer disease (PUD) refers to mucosal breaks in the stomach or duodenum that extend through the muscularis mucosae. It is one of the most common gastrointestinal disorders worldwide, with a lifetime prevalence of approximately 10% in developed countries.

### Definition

**Peptic ulcer**: A mucosal defect ≥5 mm in diameter with visible depth that extends through the muscularis mucosae into the submucosa or deeper layers.

**Types**:
- **Gastric ulcer (GU)**: Occurs in the stomach, most commonly in the lesser curvature and antrum
- **Duodenal ulcer (DU)**: Occurs in the duodenum, most commonly in the first portion (duodenal bulb)
- **Esophageal ulcer**: Less common, associated with GERD or medications
- **Anastomotic ulcer**: Occurs at surgical anastomosis (e.g., gastrojejunostomy)

### Epidemiology

**Prevalence**:
- Lifetime prevalence: 5-10% in Western countries
- Annual incidence: 0.1-0.3% in developed countries
- Duodenal ulcers are 2-3 times more common than gastric ulcers
- Male-to-female ratio: Historically 2-3:1, now approaching 1:1

**Geographic variation**:
- Higher prevalence in developing countries
- Related to H. pylori prevalence and NSAID use patterns

**Age distribution**:
- Duodenal ulcers: Peak incidence age 30-50 years
- Gastric ulcers: Peak incidence age 50-70 years
- Increasing incidence in elderly due to NSAID use

**Trends**:
- Overall declining incidence in developed countries
- Attributed to H. pylori eradication and proton pump inhibitor use
- Complications (bleeding, perforation) remain significant, especially in elderly

### Risk Factors

**Major causes** (account for >90% of cases):
- H. pylori infection: 70-90% of duodenal ulcers, 60-70% of gastric ulcers
- NSAID/aspirin use: 20-30% of ulcers
- Both H. pylori and NSAIDs: Synergistic risk

**Other risk factors**:
- Smoking: 2-fold increased risk, impairs healing
- Stress (physiologic): ICU patients, burns, trauma, surgery
- Zollinger-Ellison syndrome: Gastrinoma causing hypersecretion
- Medications: Corticosteroids (in combination with NSAIDs), SSRIs, bisphosphonates
- Cocaine use
- Crohn's disease
- Viral infections: CMV, HSV (immunocompromised)
- Radiation therapy
- Vascular insufficiency
- Idiopathic (5-10%): H. pylori-negative, NSAID-negative

## Pathophysiology

### Mucosal Defense Mechanisms

**Normal protective factors**:
- **Mucus layer**: Viscous gel barrier secreted by epithelial cells
- **Bicarbonate secretion**: Neutralizes acid at mucosal surface
- **Epithelial cell tight junctions**: Prevent acid back-diffusion
- **Mucosal blood flow**: Provides oxygen, nutrients, bicarbonate; removes acid and toxins
- **Prostaglandins**: Stimulate mucus and bicarbonate secretion, maintain blood flow
- **Epithelial regeneration**: Rapid turnover and repair of damaged cells
- **Growth factors**: EGF, TGF-α promote healing

**Aggressive factors**:
- **Gastric acid**: Peptic ulcers do not form without acid
- **Pepsin**: Protein-digesting enzyme, active at low pH
- **Bile acids**: Can damage mucosa, especially in gastric ulcers

**Balance concept**: Ulcers form when aggressive factors overwhelm protective mechanisms

### H. pylori Pathogenesis

**Organism characteristics**:
- Gram-negative, spiral, flagellated bacterium
- Colonizes gastric mucosa (cannot survive in duodenum)
- Produces urease, which generates ammonia (neutralizes acid, allows survival)
- Produces virulence factors: CagA, VacA, adhesins

**Mechanisms of ulcer formation**:

*Duodenal ulcers*:
1. H. pylori infects gastric antrum
2. Antral inflammation disrupts somatostatin-producing D cells
3. Loss of negative feedback on gastrin-producing G cells
4. Hypergastrinemia → increased acid secretion
5. Gastric metaplasia in duodenum (acid exposure)
6. H. pylori colonizes metaplastic duodenal mucosa
7. Local inflammation and ulceration

*Gastric ulcers*:
1. H. pylori causes chronic gastritis (body and antrum)
2. Reduced mucosal defense (mucus, bicarbonate)
3. Disrupted epithelial integrity
4. Normal or reduced acid secretion
5. Ulceration in setting of impaired defense

**Host response**:
- Inflammatory response: Neutrophils, lymphocytes, cytokines
- Oxidative stress
- Apoptosis of epithelial cells
- Genetic factors influence disease risk (IL-1β polymorphisms)

**Why not everyone with H. pylori develops ulcers**:
- Only 10-20% of infected individuals develop ulcers
- Depends on bacterial strain (CagA+ more virulent), host genetics, environmental factors

### NSAID-Induced Ulcers

**Mechanism of injury**:

*Systemic (COX-inhibition)*:
- NSAIDs inhibit cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes
- COX-1: Constitutively expressed, produces prostaglandins that protect gastric mucosa
- Reduced prostaglandin synthesis:
  - Decreased mucus and bicarbonate secretion
  - Reduced mucosal blood flow
  - Impaired epithelial proliferation and healing
  - Decreased platelet aggregation (increased bleeding risk)

*Local (topical)*:
- Direct irritation and damage to epithelial cells
- Disruption of mucosal barrier
- Less important than systemic effects (evident even with IV/topical NSAIDs)

**COX-2 selective inhibitors** (coxibs):
- Spare COX-1, theoretically preserve gastric protection
- Reduced GI toxicity compared to non-selective NSAIDs
- Still carry some GI risk, especially at high doses

**Risk factors for NSAID ulcers**:
- High dose or multiple NSAIDs
- Age >60 years
- History of peptic ulcer or GI bleeding
- Concurrent use of corticosteroids, anticoagulants, or SSRIs
- H. pylori infection (synergistic)
- Cardiovascular disease (often on aspirin)

### Stress Ulcers

**Definition**: Acute gastric erosions and ulcers in critically ill patients

**Pathophysiology**:
- Mucosal ischemia due to splanchnic hypoperfusion
- Impaired mucosal defense mechanisms
- Acid-related injury

**Risk factors**:
- Mechanical ventilation >48 hours
- Coagulopathy
- Severe burns (Curling ulcers)
- CNS injury (Cushing ulcers) - increased vagal tone, gastric acid hypersecretion
- Sepsis, shock
- Multi-organ failure

### Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome

**Definition**: Gastrinoma causing gastric acid hypersecretion

**Pathophysiology**:
- Gastrin-secreting tumor (usually pancreatic or duodenal)
- Excessive gastrin stimulates parietal cells
- Massive acid secretion overwhelms mucosal defenses
- Multiple, recurrent, or refractory ulcers
- Often distal duodenal or jejunal ulcers (unusual locations)

## Clinical Presentation

### Symptoms

**Classic presentation**:
- **Epigastric pain**: Burning, gnawing, or aching quality
- **Pain characteristics**:
  - Duodenal ulcer: Pain 2-5 hours after meals, nighttime pain (acid secretion peaks), relieved by food or antacids
  - Gastric ulcer: Pain soon after eating, not consistently relieved by food (sometimes worsened)
- **Periodicity**: Symptoms occur in clusters lasting weeks, followed by asymptomatic periods

**Associated symptoms**:
- Nausea and vomiting
- Bloating
- Early satiety
- Belching
- Heartburn

**Alarm symptoms** (suggest complications or malignancy):
- Unintentional weight loss
- Persistent vomiting
- Dysphagia or odynophagia
- Hematemesis or melena
- Severe or persistent abdominal pain
- Palpable mass
- Family history of gastric cancer
- Age >55 years with new-onset dyspepsia

**Asymptomatic presentation**:
- Up to 70% of NSAID-induced ulcers are asymptomatic
- First presentation may be complication (bleeding, perforation)

### Physical Examination

**Uncomplicated ulcer**:
- Often normal examination
- Mild epigastric tenderness
- No peritoneal signs

**Examination findings suggesting complications**:
- **Bleeding**: Tachycardia, hypotension, pallor, melena on rectal exam
- **Perforation**: Acute abdomen, rigid abdomen, rebound tenderness, absent bowel sounds
- **Gastric outlet obstruction**: Succession splash, visible peristalsis, distended abdomen

## Diagnosis

### Clinical Diagnosis

**Dyspepsia**: Chronic or recurrent pain or discomfort in the upper abdomen

**Differential diagnosis**:
- Functional dyspepsia (most common)
- Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)
- Gastritis
- Gastric or esophageal cancer
- Biliary disease
- Pancreatitis
- Cardiac ischemia (atypical presentation)

### Non-Invasive Testing

**H. pylori testing**:

*Urea breath test (UBT)*:
- Patient ingests ¹³C or ¹⁴C-labeled urea
- If H. pylori present, urease cleaves urea → labeled CO₂ exhaled
- Sensitivity 95-100%, specificity 95-100%
- Test of choice for non-invasive diagnosis and post-treatment confirmation
- Requires 4 weeks off PPIs, 2 weeks off antibiotics

*Stool antigen test*:
- Detects H. pylori antigens in stool
- Sensitivity 90-95%, specificity 95-98%
- Useful for diagnosis and confirming eradication
- Monoclonal antibody tests preferred over polyclonal

*Serology*:
- Detects IgG antibodies to H. pylori
- Sensitivity 85-90%, specificity 80-85%
- Cannot distinguish active from past infection (antibodies persist)
- Not useful for confirming eradication
- Useful for initial diagnosis in high-prevalence populations or active bleeding (when other tests less accurate)

### Endoscopic Evaluation

**Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD)**:

*Indications*:
- Alarm symptoms (age >55, weight loss, bleeding, dysphagia, anemia)
- Refractory symptoms despite empiric therapy
- Recurrent symptoms after initial treatment
- Need to distinguish ulcer from malignancy
- Suspected complications
- NSAID-induced ulcer requiring documentation

*Advantages*:
- Direct visualization of ulcer
- Biopsy to exclude malignancy (gastric ulcers)
- H. pylori testing (biopsy urease test, histology)
- Therapeutic intervention (hemostasis for bleeding)

**Endoscopic findings**:
- **Ulcer appearance**: Round or oval mucosal defect with depth, clean or dirty base
- **Location**:
  - Duodenal: Most commonly first portion (bulb), anterior or posterior wall
  - Gastric: Lesser curvature, antrum, incisura angularis
- **Size**: Variable, typically 5-20 mm
- **Complications**: Active bleeding, visible vessel, adherent clot, perforation

**Biopsy protocol for gastric ulcers**:
- Multiple biopsies from ulcer margin (6-8 samples)
- To exclude malignancy (gastric adenocarcinoma can mimic benign ulcer)
- Duodenal ulcers rarely malignant, biopsy not routinely needed

**H. pylori testing at endoscopy**:

*Rapid urease test (RUT)*:
- Biopsy placed in urea-containing medium with pH indicator
- If H. pylori present, urease generates ammonia, raises pH, color change
- Sensitivity 90-95%, specificity 95-100%
- Results in minutes to hours
- Can be false negative if recent PPI, antibiotic, or bismuth use, or active bleeding

*Histology*:
- Gold standard for H. pylori detection
- Hematoxylin & eosin (H&E) or special stains (Giemsa, Warthin-Starry)
- Also assesses degree of inflammation, atrophy, intestinal metaplasia
- Sensitivity 90-95%, specificity 95-100%

*Culture*:
- Not routinely performed
- Indicated for antibiotic susceptibility testing in refractory cases

### Imaging

**Upper GI series (barium study)**:
- Historical method, largely replaced by endoscopy
- Can detect ulcer crater
- Cannot biopsy, less sensitive than endoscopy

**CT scan**:
- Not for routine diagnosis
- Useful for suspected perforation (pneumoperitoneum) or other complications
- Can identify gastric wall thickening, but cannot reliably distinguish benign from malignant

### Laboratory Tests

**Basic tests**:
- Complete blood count: Anemia (chronic bleeding), elevated MCV (B12 deficiency in atrophic gastritis)
- Iron studies: Iron deficiency in chronic blood loss
- Fasting gastrin level: If Zollinger-Ellison syndrome suspected (>1000 pg/mL highly suggestive)
- Secretin stimulation test: Confirms gastrinoma (paradoxical rise in gastrin)

## Treatment

### General Principles

**Goals**:
- Relieve symptoms
- Promote ulcer healing
- Eradicate H. pylori (if present)
- Prevent recurrence and complications

**Ulcer healing**:
- Duodenal ulcers: 80-90% heal in 4 weeks, >95% in 8 weeks with acid suppression
- Gastric ulcers: 60-70% heal in 6 weeks, 80-90% in 12 weeks
- H. pylori eradication accelerates healing and prevents recurrence

### Lifestyle Modifications

**Dietary**:
- No specific diet required
- Avoid foods that trigger symptoms
- Regular meal times
- No evidence that bland diet or milk promotes healing

**Behavioral**:
- Smoking cessation: Critical for healing and preventing recurrence
- Alcohol moderation: Avoid excessive intake
- Stress reduction: May help symptom management

**Medication avoidance**:
- Discontinue NSAIDs if possible
- If NSAIDs necessary, use lowest effective dose, COX-2 selective preferred
- Avoid aspirin unless indicated for cardiovascular prophylaxis

### Acid Suppression Therapy

**Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs)** - First-line therapy:

*Mechanism*:
- Irreversibly inhibit H⁺/K⁺-ATPase (proton pump) in parietal cells
- Profound acid suppression (90-98% reduction)
- Most effective acid suppressants available

*Examples and dosing*:
- Omeprazole 20-40 mg daily
- Lansoprazole 30 mg daily
- Pantoprazole 40 mg daily
- Esomeprazole 40 mg daily
- Rabeprazole 20 mg daily

*Duration*:
- Uncomplicated duodenal ulcer: 4-8 weeks
- Uncomplicated gastric ulcer: 8-12 weeks
- Complicated ulcers: May require longer duration

*Administration*:
- Take 30-60 minutes before first meal (breakfast)
- Requires acid in stomach to be activated
- Once daily usually sufficient; BID dosing for refractory cases

*Efficacy*:
- Superior to H2RAs for healing and symptom relief
- Duodenal ulcer healing: >90% at 4 weeks
- Gastric ulcer healing: >80% at 8 weeks

**H2-receptor antagonists (H2RAs)** - Alternative:

*Mechanism*:
- Competitively block histamine H2 receptors on parietal cells
- Reduce acid secretion by 60-70%

*Examples*:
- Famotidine 20-40 mg BID
- Nizatidine 150-300 mg BID
- Cimetidine 400-800 mg BID (drug interactions, less commonly used)

*Efficacy*:
- Less effective than PPIs
- Duodenal ulcer healing: 70-80% at 4 weeks, 87-94% at 8 weeks
- Gastric ulcer healing: 60-70% at 6 weeks, 80-87% at 12 weeks

*Tachyphylaxis*:
- Tolerance develops within 2 weeks of continuous use
- Limits long-term efficacy

**Antacids**:
- Neutralize gastric acid
- Provide rapid but short-lived symptom relief
- Not effective as monotherapy for healing
- Can be used as needed for breakthrough symptoms

**Sucralfate**:
- Forms protective barrier over ulcer
- Minimal systemic absorption
- Less effective than PPIs or H2RAs
- Dosing: 1 g four times daily, on empty stomach

### H. pylori Eradication

**Indications for testing and treatment**:
- Active peptic ulcer disease
- History of peptic ulcer disease
- Gastric MALT lymphoma
- Post-gastric cancer resection
- Uninvestigated dyspepsia (in high-prevalence populations)
- First-degree relatives of gastric cancer patients
- Long-term NSAID or aspirin use planned
- Unexplained iron deficiency anemia

**Treatment regimens** (treat for 14 days):

*First-line therapy (in areas with low clarithromycin resistance <15%)*:

**Clarithromycin triple therapy**:
- PPI (standard dose BID) + Clarithromycin 500 mg BID + Amoxicillin 1 g BID
- Eradication rate: 70-85% (declining due to resistance)

**Bismuth quadruple therapy** (preferred first-line in many regions):
- PPI (standard dose BID) + Bismuth subsalicylate 525 mg QID + Tetracycline 500 mg QID + Metronidazole 500 mg TID-QID
- Eradication rate: 75-90%
- Effective even with clarithromycin or metronidazole resistance

*First-line therapy (in areas with high clarithromycin resistance >15%)*:

**Concomitant therapy** (non-bismuth quadruple):
- PPI (standard dose BID) + Clarithromycin 500 mg BID + Amoxicillin 1 g BID + Metronidazole 500 mg BID
- Eradication rate: 85-90%

**Sequential therapy**:
- Days 1-5: PPI BID + Amoxicillin 1 g BID
- Days 6-10: PPI BID + Clarithromycin 500 mg BID + Metronidazole 500 mg BID
- Eradication rate: 80-90%
- Less commonly used due to complexity

*Second-line therapy (after first-line failure)*:

**If bismuth not used first-line**:
- Bismuth quadruple therapy (as above)

**If bismuth used first-line**:
- Levofloxacin triple therapy: PPI BID + Levofloxacin 500 mg daily + Amoxicillin 1 g BID
- Eradication rate: 70-85%

*Third-line therapy*:
- Culture and antibiotic susceptibility testing
- Rifabutin-based therapy: PPI BID + Amoxicillin 1 g BID + Rifabutin 150 mg BID

**Factors affecting eradication success**:
- Antibiotic resistance: Clarithromycin resistance most problematic
- Treatment duration: 14 days superior to 10 days, which superior to 7 days
- Adherence: Critical for success
- PPI metabolism: Rapid metabolizers may have lower cure rates
- Smoking: Reduces eradication rates

**Post-treatment testing**:
- Confirm eradication with urea breath test or stool antigen test
- Wait at least 4 weeks after completing antibiotics and PPIs
- Serology not useful (antibodies persist)

### NSAID-Related Ulcers

**Prevention in high-risk patients**:
- PPI prophylaxis: Reduces ulcer risk by 70-80%
- Misoprostol 200 mcg QID: Effective but poorly tolerated (diarrhea)
- COX-2 selective NSAIDs: Lower risk than non-selective, but not risk-free
- Test and treat H. pylori before starting NSAIDs

**Treatment**:
- Discontinue NSAID if possible
- PPI therapy for 8-12 weeks
- If NSAID cannot be stopped: Continue PPI, consider COX-2 selective agent
- Test and treat H. pylori (eradication alone insufficient if NSAID continued)

### Refractory Ulcers

**Definition**: Ulcer persists despite 8-12 weeks of standard PPI therapy

**Causes**:
- Poor adherence to medication
- NSAID use (often undisclosed)
- Persistent H. pylori infection (inadequate eradication)
- Zollinger-Ellison syndrome
- Cigarette smoking
- Resistant bacterial or viral infections (CMV, HSV)
- Gastric malignancy (misdiagnosed as benign ulcer)
- Crohn's disease
- Cameron ulcers (in hiatal hernia)

**Evaluation**:
- Review medication adherence
- Confirm H. pylori eradication status
- Consider higher PPI dose (BID dosing)
- Repeat endoscopy with biopsies
- Measure fasting gastrin level
- Rule out surreptitious NSAID use

### Special Populations

**Pregnant women**:
- Avoid NSAIDs (especially third trimester)
- PPIs generally safe (Category B/C depending on agent)
- Sucralfate safe

**Elderly**:
- Higher risk of complications
- More likely asymptomatic until complication
- Careful NSAID use, aggressive prevention strategies

## Complications

### Upper Gastrointestinal Bleeding

**Epidemiology**:
- Most common complication (15-20% of peptic ulcers)
- Accounts for 50% of upper GI bleeding cases
- Mortality: 5-10% overall, higher in elderly and with comorbidities

**Presentation**:
- Hematemesis: Coffee-ground or bright red blood
- Melena: Black, tarry stools (>50-100 mL blood loss)
- Hematochezia: Bright red rectal bleeding (massive upper GI bleed with rapid transit)
- Syncope, lightheadedness (significant blood loss)
- Symptoms of anemia: Fatigue, dyspnea

**Risk factors**:
- NSAID use
- Anticoagulants or antiplatelet agents
- Advanced age
- H. pylori infection
- Prior bleeding history
- Comorbidities

**Management**:
- Resuscitation: IV access, crystalloid, blood transfusion (target Hgb 7-9 g/dL)
- Risk stratification: Glasgow-Blatchford score, Rockall score
- High-dose PPI: Bolus followed by continuous infusion (80 mg bolus, then 8 mg/hr for 72 hours)
- Urgent endoscopy (within 24 hours, sooner if hemodynamically unstable)
- Endoscopic therapy:
  - Injection (epinephrine)
  - Thermal coagulation (heater probe, bipolar electrocoagulation)
  - Mechanical (hemoclips)
  - Combination therapy preferred
- Post-endoscopy: Oral PPI BID for 2 weeks, then once daily
- Interventional radiology or surgery if endoscopic therapy fails

**Endoscopic classification (Forrest classification)**:
- Ia: Spurting arterial bleeding (high risk)
- Ib: Oozing bleeding (high risk)
- IIa: Visible vessel (high risk)
- IIb: Adherent clot (moderate risk)
- IIc: Flat pigmented spot (low risk)
- III: Clean base (low risk)

### Perforation

**Epidemiology**:
- 5-10% of peptic ulcers
- More common with anterior duodenal ulcers (thin wall)
- Mortality: 10-40%, depending on age and comorbidities

**Presentation**:
- Sudden, severe abdominal pain (often described as "worst pain of life")
- Diffuse abdominal pain (peritonitis from chemical/bacterial contamination)
- Rigid, board-like abdomen
- Rebound tenderness
- Absent bowel sounds
- Shoulder pain (diaphragmatic irritation)
- Fever, tachycardia, hypotension (septic shock)

**Diagnosis**:
- Clinical suspicion based on history and examination
- Upright chest X-ray or left lateral decubitus: Pneumoperitoneum (free air under diaphragm) in 70-80%
- CT scan: More sensitive (>90%), shows free air, fluid, wall thickening

**Management**:
- Resuscitation: IV fluids, antibiotics, NPO
- Surgical consultation (emergency)
- Options:
  - **Laparoscopic or open repair**: Graham patch (omental patch closure)
  - **Definitive surgery**: Rare in modern era (vagotomy and pyloroplasty, partial gastrectomy)
  - **Non-operative management**: Selected stable patients with sealed perforation on imaging
- Post-operative: PPI therapy, H. pylori eradication if present

### Gastric Outlet Obstruction

**Epidemiology**:
- 1-2% of peptic ulcers
- More common with duodenal ulcers (especially channel ulcers) or antral gastric ulcers
- Causes: Acute edema and inflammation, chronic scarring and fibrosis

**Presentation**:
- Postprandial nausea and vomiting (often hours after eating)
- Vomiting of undigested food
- Early satiety
- Abdominal bloating, fullness
- Weight loss
- Succession splash on examination

**Diagnosis**:
- Endoscopy: Visualize ulcer, assess outlet patency, exclude malignancy
- CT scan: Gastric distention, wall thickening
- Upper GI series: Delayed gastric emptying, narrowed lumen

**Management**:
- Nasogastric decompression
- IV fluids, correct electrolytes (hypokalemic, hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis from vomiting)
- High-dose PPI therapy
- H. pylori eradication if present
- Endoscopic balloon dilation (for strictures)
- Surgery (if refractory): Vagotomy and antrectomy, gastrojejunostomy

### Penetration

**Definition**: Ulcer extends through wall into adjacent organs (pancreas, liver, biliary tree, colon)

**Presentation**:
- Change in pain pattern: Constant, severe, radiates to back (pancreatic penetration)
- No longer relieved by food or antacids
- Elevated amylase/lipase (if pancreatic)

**Diagnosis**:
- CT scan: Most useful
- Endoscopy: Deep ulcer crater

**Management**:
- High-dose PPI therapy
- H. pylori eradication
- Often requires surgical intervention

## Prognosis

### Natural History

**With treatment**:
- Most ulcers heal with acid suppression and H. pylori eradication
- Duodenal ulcers: >95% heal by 8 weeks
- Gastric ulcers: >90% heal by 12 weeks

**Without treatment**:
- Chronic, relapsing course
- 50-90% recurrence within 1 year

### Recurrence

**Risk factors**:
- Persistent H. pylori infection: 60-90% recurrence within 1 year
- Continued NSAID use: 50-70% recurrence
- Smoking: 2-fold increased recurrence risk
- Incomplete ulcer healing

**Prevention**:
- H. pylori eradication: Reduces recurrence to <5% per year
- Maintenance PPI therapy (if cannot stop NSAIDs or H. pylori-negative, idiopathic ulcer)
- Smoking cessation

### Mortality

**Overall mortality**:
- Uncomplicated ulcer: <1%
- Complicated ulcer: 5-10%
- Bleeding ulcer: 5-10%
- Perforated ulcer: 10-40%

**Factors affecting mortality**:
- Age >60 years
- Comorbidities (cardiovascular, renal, hepatic disease)
- Shock on presentation
- Hemoglobin <8 g/dL
- Active bleeding at endoscopy
- Delayed treatment

## Key Points

- Peptic ulcer disease is primarily caused by H. pylori infection and NSAID use; both should be addressed in management
- Duodenal ulcers typically cause pain 2-5 hours after meals, while gastric ulcers cause pain soon after eating
- EGD is diagnostic and allows for biopsy; all gastric ulcers should be biopsied to exclude malignancy
- PPIs are first-line therapy for ulcer healing; treatment duration is 4-8 weeks for duodenal ulcers, 8-12 weeks for gastric ulcers
- H. pylori eradication is critical and should be confirmed with post-treatment testing (urea breath test or stool antigen)
- Bismuth quadruple therapy is increasingly preferred as first-line due to rising clarithromycin resistance
- Major complications include bleeding (15-20%), perforation (5-10%), and gastric outlet obstruction (1-2%)
- NSAID-induced ulcers are often asymptomatic; high-risk patients should receive PPI prophylaxis
- Refractory ulcers require evaluation for persistent H. pylori, continued NSAID use, Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, or malignancy
- Ulcer recurrence is dramatically reduced with H. pylori eradication (<5% vs 60-90% per year)
