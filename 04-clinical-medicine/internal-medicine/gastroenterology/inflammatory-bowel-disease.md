# Inflammatory Bowel Disease

## Overview

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) refers to chronic inflammatory conditions of the gastrointestinal tract, primarily comprising two disorders: Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). These are chronic, relapsing-remitting immune-mediated conditions characterized by intestinal inflammation that significantly impacts quality of life.

### Definition

**Inflammatory bowel disease**: Chronic inflammatory disorders of the gastrointestinal tract resulting from a complex interplay of genetic susceptibility, environmental factors, intestinal microbiota, and immune dysregulation.

**Two main types**:
- **Crohn's disease**: Can affect any part of GI tract from mouth to anus, transmural inflammation, skip lesions
- **Ulcerative colitis**: Limited to colon, continuous mucosal inflammation starting from rectum

### Epidemiology

**Prevalence**:
- United States: 1.3 million people with IBD
- Ulcerative colitis: 250-500 per 100,000
- Crohn's disease: 200-300 per 100,000
- Incidence rising globally, especially in newly industrialized countries

**Age distribution**:
- Bimodal peak: 15-30 years (primary), 50-70 years (secondary)
- Can occur at any age, including children and elderly

**Geographic variation**:
- Higher prevalence in developed countries
- Highest rates in North America and Europe
- Increasing incidence in Asia, Africa, South America (urbanization, Western lifestyle)

**Demographics**:
- Slightly higher in females for CD, equal for UC
- Higher in Ashkenazi Jews (2-4 times)
- More common in urban than rural populations
- Familial clustering (10-25% have affected first-degree relative)

**Trends**:
- Incidence stabilizing in developed countries but still high
- Rapidly increasing in previously low-incidence areas
- Earlier age of onset in recent decades

### Risk Factors

**Genetic**:
- First-degree relative with IBD: 10-fold increased risk
- Twin studies: Concordance 50% (CD), 15% (UC) in monozygotic twins
- >200 susceptibility loci identified (NOD2/CARD15, IL23R, ATG16L1, IRGM)
- Polygenic inheritance

**Environmental**:
- Smoking:
  - CD: Doubles risk, worsens disease course
  - UC: Protective effect (paradoxically), worsens after smoking cessation
- Appendectomy: Protective for UC, may increase CD risk
- Antibiotic use: Especially in childhood
- Diet: High fat, refined sugars, low fiber (Western diet)
- Hygiene hypothesis: Reduced microbial exposure in childhood
- Urbanization: Sanitation, dietary changes
- Vitamin D deficiency
- Infections: Possible triggers
- NSAIDs: May precipitate flares

**Microbiome**:
- Dysbiosis (altered gut microbiota composition)
- Reduced diversity
- Loss of protective bacteria (e.g., Faecalibacterium prausnitzii)
- Increased pathogenic bacteria

**Immunologic**:
- Dysregulated mucosal immune response
- Loss of tolerance to commensal bacteria
- Excessive Th1/Th17 response in CD
- Atypical Th2 response in UC

## Pathophysiology

### Immune Dysregulation

**Normal intestinal immunity**:
- Intact epithelial barrier
- Controlled immune response to commensal bacteria
- Regulatory T cells maintain tolerance

**IBD pathogenesis**:
- Genetic predisposition + environmental trigger → inappropriate immune response
- Loss of immunologic tolerance to intestinal microbiota
- Excessive pro-inflammatory cytokine production
- Impaired regulatory mechanisms

**Crohn's disease**:
- Th1 and Th17-mediated immune response
- Key cytokines: IL-12, IL-23, IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-17
- Transmural inflammation with granuloma formation (non-caseating)
- Defects in autophagy and bacterial handling (NOD2 mutations)

**Ulcerative colitis**:
- Atypical Th2 immune response
- Key cytokines: IL-5, IL-13
- Mucosal inflammation only
- Neutrophil infiltration, crypt abscesses

### Epithelial Barrier Dysfunction

**Mechanisms**:
- Increased intestinal permeability
- Tight junction dysfunction
- Epithelial cell apoptosis
- Mucus layer alterations
- Allows bacterial translocation, perpetuates inflammation

### Microbiome Alterations

**Dysbiosis in IBD**:
- Reduced diversity (especially Firmicutes)
- Increased adherent-invasive E. coli (AIEC) in CD
- Loss of beneficial bacteria (Faecalibacterium)
- Altered metabolite production (short-chain fatty acids)

## Clinical Presentation

### Crohn's Disease

**Location** (Montreal Classification):
- L1: Ileal (30%) - terminal ileum
- L2: Colonic (25%) - any colon location
- L3: Ileocolonic (40%) - both ileum and colon
- L4: Upper GI (5-10%) - esophagus, stomach, duodenum, jejunum (often in addition to L1-L3)

**Behavior**:
- B1: Non-stricturing, non-penetrating (inflammatory)
- B2: Stricturing (fibrotic narrowing)

### Extraintestinal Manifestations

**Common in both CD and UC** (occur in 25-40%):

*Musculoskeletal* (most common):
- **Peripheral arthropathy** (Type 1: Pauciarticular, large joints, parallels bowel disease; Type 2: Polyarticular, small joints, independent of bowel activity)
- **Axial arthropathy**: Ankylosing spondylitis, sacroiliitis (associated with HLA-B27)
- Osteoporosis, osteopenia (inflammation, steroids, malabsorption)

*Dermatologic*:
- **Erythema nodosum**: Tender, raised nodules on shins, parallels disease activity
- **Pyoderma gangrenosum**: Ulcerative skin lesions, often lower extremities, independent of disease activity
- Aphthous stomatitis (oral ulcers)
- Sweet syndrome (rare)

*Ophthalmologic*:
- Episcleritis: Red eye, mild pain, parallels disease
- Uveitis: Painful, photophobia, vision changes, medical emergency
- Scleritis (rare)

*Hepatobiliary*:
- **Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC)**: 3-7% of IBD (mostly UC), cholestatic liver disease, increased colorectal cancer risk
- Cholelithiasis (CD with ileal disease - bile acid malabsorption)

- Autoimmune hepatitis (rare)

*Other*:
- Thromboembolic disease: DVT, PE (hypercoagulable state)

## Diagnosis

### Clinical Evaluation

**History**:
- Diarrhea pattern, duration, blood/mucus
- Abdominal pain location, character
- Systemic symptoms
- Family history of IBD
- Recent infections, antibiotic use
- Smoking history
- Travel history

**Differential diagnosis**:
- Infectious colitis (bacterial, viral, parasitic, C. difficile)
- Ischemic colitis
- Microscopic colitis
- Celiac disease
- IBS (no inflammation)
- Colon cancer
- Diverticulitis
- Medication-induced (NSAIDs)
- Behçet's disease
- Intestinal tuberculosis

### Laboratory Tests

**Inflammatory markers**:
- C-reactive protein (CRP): Elevated in active disease (better in CD than UC)
- Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR): Elevated
- Fecal calprotectin: Sensitive marker of intestinal inflammation, useful for monitoring

**Stool studies**:
- Stool culture: Exclude infectious causes
- C. difficile toxin: Common superinfection or mimic
- Ova and parasites
- Fecal calprotectin >50 μg/g suggests organic disease

**Complete blood count**:
- Anemia: Iron deficiency (blood loss), anemia of chronic disease, B12/folate deficiency
- Leukocytosis: Active inflammation
- Thrombocytosis: Inflammatory state

**Metabolic panel**:
- Albumin: Low in severe disease (protein loss, malnutrition)
- Electrolytes: Abnormalities from diarrhea

**Nutritional markers**:
- Iron, ferritin, transferrin saturation
- Vitamin B12 (ileal disease/resection in CD)
- Folate
- Vitamin D, calcium
- Zinc, magnesium

**Serologic markers** (limited utility):
- ASCA (anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies): More common in CD (60-70%)
- p-ANCA (perinuclear anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies): More common in UC (50-80%)
- Not diagnostic, may help in indeterminate colitis

### Endoscopy

**Colonoscopy with ileoscopy** - Gold standard:

*Ulcerative colitis findings*:
- **Distribution**: Continuous inflammation starting from rectum, extends proximally
- Rectal involvement (almost always)
- Sharp demarcation between inflamed and normal mucosa
- **Mucosal changes**: Erythema, loss of vascular pattern, granularity, friability, spontaneous bleeding
- **Ulceration**: Superficial ulcers
- Pseudopolyps (inflammatory polyps)
- **Chronic changes**: Atrophy, loss of haustral folds ("lead pipe" colon)

*Crohn's disease findings*:
- **Distribution**: Skip lesions (discontinuous), any GI segment
- Rectal sparing common
- **Mucosal changes**: Aphthous ulcers, deep linear/serpiginous ulcers
- "Cobblestoning" (combination of ulcers and edematous mucosa)
- Strictures
- Fistula openings
- Ileal involvement (visualized with ileoscopy)

**Upper endoscopy** (EGD):
- If upper GI symptoms or suspected upper GI CD
- Findings in CD: Aphthous ulcers, erosions, strictures

**Biopsies** - Essential for diagnosis:

*Ulcerative colitis histology*:
- Mucosal and superficial submucosal inflammation only
- Diffuse, continuous inflammation
- Crypt architectural distortion: Branching, shortening
- Crypt abscesses: Neutrophils in crypt lumen
- Depletion of goblet cells
- Basal plasmacytosis
- Paneth cell metaplasia (left colon)

*Crohn's disease histology*:
- Transmural inflammation (full-thickness)
- Discontinuous, patchy inflammation
- Non-caseating granulomas (30-50%, pathognomonic but not required)
- Cryptitis, crypt abscesses
- Fissuring ulcers
- Preserved goblet cells
- Lymphoid aggregates

### Imaging

**Cross-sectional imaging** - Essential for CD:

*CT enterography (CTE)*:
- Small bowel inflammation, wall thickening, enhancement
- Strictures, fistulas, abscesses
- Mesenteric fat stranding ("creeping fat")
- Advantages: Widely available, fast
- Disadvantages: Radiation exposure

*MR enterography (MRE)*:
- Similar to CTE, better soft tissue contrast
- No radiation (preferred for young patients, repeated imaging)
- Advantages: Best for small bowel, fistulas, perianal disease
- Disadvantages: Cost, availability, longer scan time

*Small bowel follow-through/enteroclysis*:
- Largely replaced by CTE/MRE
- Barium study of small bowel

**Ultrasound**:
- Transabdominal: Can assess bowel wall thickness, inflammation
- Perianal/endorectal: Excellent for perianal fistulas, abscesses

**CT abdomen/pelvis** (non-enterography):
- Acute setting: Perforation, abscess, obstruction
- Not ideal for mucosal disease assessment

**Video capsule endoscopy**:
- Visualizes entire small bowel mucosa
- Indications: Suspected CD with negative ileocolonoscopy
- Contraindications: Strictures (capsule retention risk), dysphagia, known obstruction
- Pre-screen with patency capsule if stricture suspected

**Balloon-assisted enteroscopy**:
- Deep small bowel intubation
- Biopsy and therapeutic interventions
- Time-consuming, specialized procedure

### Disease Activity Indices

**Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI)**:
- Clinical research tool
- Includes: Number of liquid stools, abdominal pain, general well-being, extraintestinal manifestations, antidiarrheal use, abdominal mass, hematocrit, weight
- Score interpretation: <150 (remission), 150-220 (mild), 220-450 (moderate), >450 (severe)

**Harvey-Bradshaw Index**:
- Simplified CDAI for clinical use

**Mayo Score** (UC):
- Stool frequency, rectal bleeding, endoscopic findings, physician global assessment
- Score 0-12: Higher score = more severe

**Simple Endoscopic Score for CD (SES-CD)**:
- Ulcer size, ulcerated surface, affected surface, stenosis
- Objective endoscopic assessment

## Treatment

### Goals of Therapy

- Induce and maintain remission
- Heal mucosa
- Improve quality of life
- Prevent complications
- Minimize steroid use
- Avoid surgery when possible

### Treatment Strategy

**"Step-up" vs "Top-down"**:
- Step-up: Start with less aggressive therapy, escalate if needed
- Top-down: Early aggressive therapy (biologics) in high-risk patients
- Treat-to-target: Objective endpoints (mucosal healing), not just symptom control

### Medications

- With permanent ileostomy
- Indications: Refractory disease, dysplasia/cancer, toxic megacolon
- Complications: Pouchitis (40-50%), infertility, incontinence

**Crohn's disease**:
- Surgery not curative (disease can recur)
- Bowel-sparing resection
- Strictureplasty (for strictures, preserves bowel length)
- Segmental resection (for obstruction, perforation)
- Perianal surgery: Seton placement, fistulotomy, advancement flap
- Post-op recurrence: 50% at 5 years (endoscopic), 30% clinical
- Post-op prophylaxis: Anti-TNF (if high risk), thiopurines

## Complications

### Intestinal Complications

- Treatment: IV steroids, antibiotics, decompression; colectomy if no response in 24-48 hours

**Hemorrhage**:
- Severe GI bleeding, rare
- Treatment: Resuscitation, medical therapy, embolization, or surgery

### Colorectal Cancer

**Epidemiology**:
- 2-3 fold increased risk in IBD
- Risk factors: Extensive colitis, long disease duration (>8-10 years), PSC, family history, persistent inflammation

**Pathogenesis**:
- Inflammation → dysplasia → carcinoma sequence
- Multifocal dysplasia possible

**Screening**:
- Start 8 years after IBD diagnosis (extensive colitis) or at diagnosis (PSC)
- Colonoscopy every 1-3 years (based on risk factors)
- Chromoendoscopy or high-definition white light
- Random biopsies or targeted biopsies of abnormalities

**Management**:
- Dysplasia: Endoscopic resection (if focal, visible lesion) or colectomy (if flat, multifocal, or high-grade)
- Cancer: Colectomy

### Malnutrition

**Causes**:
- Reduced intake (pain, anorexia)
- Malabsorption (CD with small bowel involvement)
- Protein loss (inflammation)
- Increased metabolic demands

**Deficiencies**:
- Iron (anemia)
- Vitamin B12 (ileal disease/resection)
- Folate
- Vitamin D, calcium (risk of osteoporosis)
- Fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K)
- Zinc, magnesium

**Management**:
- Nutritional assessment
- Supplementation
- Enteral nutrition (if severe malnutrition or growth failure)

### Extraintestinal Complications

- As described in Clinical Presentation section
- May require specific treatment independent of IBD activity

## Prognosis

### Disease Course

**Natural history**:
- Chronic, relapsing-remitting
- Periods of active disease alternating with remission

**Crohn's disease**:
- 50% require surgery within 10 years
- Post-operative recurrence common
- Progression from inflammatory to stricturing/penetrating phenotype over time

**Ulcerative colitis**:
- 20-30% require colectomy
- Colectomy is curative for intestinal disease
- Extraintestinal manifestations may persist

### Prognostic Factors

**Worse prognosis**:
- Young age at diagnosis
- Extensive disease
- Perianal disease (CD)
- Need for steroids at diagnosis
- Smoking (CD)
- Severe endoscopic disease

**Better prognosis**:
- Mucosal healing
- Limited disease extent
- Early treatment with biologics

### Quality of Life

- Significant impact on work, education, relationships
- Chronic symptoms, frequent medical visits
- Anxiety, depression common
- Improved with effective disease control

## Key Points

- IBD comprises Crohn's disease (transmural, skip lesions, any GI location) and ulcerative colitis (mucosal, continuous, colon only)
- Diagnosis requires combination of clinical, endoscopic, histologic, and radiologic findings; exclude infectious causes
- Extraintestinal manifestations affect 25-40% of patients and include arthritis, skin lesions, eye disease, and PSC
- Treatment goals include inducing/maintaining remission, mucosal healing, and preventing complications using a "treat-to-target" approach
- 5-ASA is first-line for mild-moderate UC but has limited role in CD; corticosteroids for induction only, never maintenance
- Biologics (anti-TNF, vedolizumab, ustekinumab) are indicated for moderate-severe disease and have transformed IBD management
- Surgery is curative for UC (colectomy) but not for CD (recurrence common); indicated for refractory disease or complications
- Increased colorectal cancer risk requires surveillance colonoscopy starting 8 years after diagnosis
- Complications include strictures, fistulas, abscesses, toxic megacolon, and malnutrition requiring specific management
- Mucosal healing is the key therapeutic endpoint associated with better long-term outcomes
