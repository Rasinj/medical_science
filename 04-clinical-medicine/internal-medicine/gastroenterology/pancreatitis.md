# Pancreatitis

## Overview

Pancreatitis is inflammation of the pancreas that can present as an acute, life-threatening illness or chronic, progressive disease. It results from inappropriate activation of pancreatic enzymes leading to autodigestion of pancreatic tissue and systemic inflammation.

### Definition

**Acute pancreatitis (AP)**: Acute inflammatory process of the pancreas with variable involvement of peripancreatic tissues and remote organ systems

**Chronic pancreatitis (CP)**: Progressive inflammatory disorder characterized by irreversible morphologic changes, including fibrosis, ductal changes, and calcifications, leading to permanent loss of exocrine and endocrine function

### Epidemiology

**Acute pancreatitis**:
- Incidence: 4.9-73.4 per 100,000 population (varies by region)
- United States: ~275,000 hospitalizations annually
- Leading GI cause of hospitalization in the US
- Mortality: 1-2% overall, up to 20-30% in severe cases
- Cost: >$2.5 billion annually in US

**Chronic pancreatitis**:
- Prevalence: 42-73 per 100,000 population
- Incidence: 4-12 per 100,000 per year
- Mean age at diagnosis: 50-55 years
- Male predominance (2-3:1)
- Median survival after diagnosis: 20-24 years (reduced compared to general population)

### Risk Factors

**Acute pancreatitis causes** (GET SMASHED mnemonic):
- **G**allstones (40-50%): Most common, especially stones <5 mm
- **E**thanol (30%): Chronic alcohol use, acute intoxication
- **T**rauma: Blunt abdominal trauma, ERCP, surgery
- **S**teroids (rare)
- **M**umps and other infections (viral, parasitic)
- **A**utoimmune: IgG4-related disease
- **S**corpion stings, snake bites (rare)
- **H**yperlipidemia: Triglycerides >1000 mg/dL
- Hypercalcemia: Hyperparathyroidism
- **E**RCP: Post-procedure (5-10% risk)
- **D**rugs: Azathioprine, 6-MP, valproic acid, pentamidine, sulfonamides, many others

**Other causes**:
- Pancreatic divisum (most common congenital anomaly)
- Pancreatic or ampullary tumors
- Genetic mutations: PRSS1, SPINK1, CFTR (cystic fibrosis gene)
- Sphincter of Oddi dysfunction
- Ischemia
- Idiopathic (10-15%)

**Chronic pancreatitis causes**:
- Alcohol (70-80%): Most common, requires heavy consumption (>5 drinks/day for >5 years typically)
- Idiopathic (10-20%)
- Hereditary: PRSS1 mutation (autosomal dominant)
- Cystic fibrosis: CFTR mutations
- Autoimmune: Type 1 (IgG4-related), Type 2 (isolated pancreatic)
- Recurrent acute pancreatitis
- Obstructive: Pancreatic duct stricture, stones, tumors
- Tropical pancreatitis (developing countries)

## Pathophysiology

### Acute Pancreatitis

**Initiating events**:
- Premature activation of digestive enzymes (trypsinogen → trypsin) within pancreatic acinar cells
- Trypsin activates other zymogens (elastase, phospholipase A2, chymotrypsinogen)
- Autodigestion of pancreas and surrounding tissues

**Mechanisms of enzyme activation**:
- **Gallstone pancreatitis**: Stone impaction at ampulla of Vater → bile reflux into pancreatic duct → enzyme activation
- **Alcohol pancreatitis**: Direct toxic effect on acinar cells, premature enzyme activation, increased viscosity of pancreatic secretions
- **Hypertriglyceridemia**: Triglyceride breakdown → toxic free fatty acids → acinar cell injury

**Local effects**:
- Acinar cell injury and necrosis
- Interstitial edema (mild pancreatitis) or necrosis (severe pancreatitis)
- Peripancreatic fat necrosis
- Vascular injury → hemorrhage
- Fluid sequestration (third-spacing)

**Systemic effects**:
- Release of inflammatory mediators (cytokines: IL-1, IL-6, TNF-α)
- Systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS)
- Increased vascular permeability → capillary leak
- Multiorgan dysfunction:
  - Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
  - Acute kidney injury
  - Cardiovascular collapse
  - Coagulopathy (DIC)

**Severity determinants**:
- Extent of necrosis
- Infection of necrotic tissue
- Organ failure

### Chronic Pancreatitis

**Progression**:
- Recurrent acute inflammation OR chronic toxic injury (alcohol)
- Chronic inflammation → activation of pancreatic stellate cells
- Progressive fibrosis
- Ductal changes: Strictures, calculi, dilatation
- Acinar cell atrophy
- Loss of islet cells

**Functional consequences**:
- **Exocrine insufficiency**: Loss of >90% function → malabsorption (steatorrhea, weight loss, fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies)
- **Endocrine insufficiency**: Diabetes mellitus (30-70% of patients)
- **Chronic pain**: Neuropathic, increased intraductal pressure, inflammation

**Mechanisms of pain**:
- Pancreatic duct hypertension (obstruction by stones, strictures)
- Inflammatory mediators
- Neural changes (increased nerve density, perineural inflammation)
- Pseudocyst formation

## Clinical Presentation

### Acute Pancreatitis

**Symptoms**:
- **Epigastric pain**: Cardinal symptom (90-95%)
  - Sudden onset, severe, constant
  - Radiates to back (50%)
  - Worse when supine, improved leaning forward
- **Nausea and vomiting** (75-90%): Often severe, persistent
- Anorexia

**Physical examination**:
- **Vital signs**: Tachycardia, tachypnea, fever, hypotension (if severe)
- **Abdominal examination**:
  - Epigastric tenderness
  - Distention (ileus)
  - Guarding (if peritonitis)
  - Hypoactive bowel sounds
- **Cullen sign**: Periumbilical ecchymosis (hemorrhagic pancreatitis, rare)
- **Grey Turner sign**: Flank ecchymosis (hemorrhagic pancreatitis, rare)
- **Jaundice**: If biliary obstruction (gallstone pancreatitis)
- **Decreased breath sounds**: Pleural effusion, atelectasis

**Severity spectrum**:
- **Mild** (80-85%): Interstitial edema, no organ failure, resolves within 1 week
- **Moderately severe** (10-15%): Local complications and/or transient organ failure (<48 hours)
- **Severe** (5-10%): Persistent organ failure (>48 hours), high mortality (20-30%)

### Chronic Pancreatitis

**Symptoms**:
- **Chronic abdominal pain** (80-90%): Similar to acute pancreatitis, may be constant or episodic
- **Steatorrhea**: Greasy, foul-smelling, bulky stools (exocrine insufficiency)
- **Weight loss**: Malabsorption, anorexia, food aversion (pain triggers)
- **Diabetes**: Polyuria, polydipsia (endocrine insufficiency)
- **Recurrent acute pancreatitis episodes**
- **Pain "burnout"**: 10-15% become pain-free as gland "burns out" (complete atrophy)

**Physical examination**:
- Often normal
- Epigastric tenderness
- Cachexia, muscle wasting
- Jaundice (if biliary obstruction from pancreatic head mass or stricture)

**Complications**:
- Pancreatic pseudocyst
- Bile duct or duodenal obstruction
- Splenic vein thrombosis → gastric varices
- Pancreatic ascites or pleural effusion (duct disruption)
- Pancreatic cancer (increased risk)

## Diagnosis

### Acute Pancreatitis

**Diagnostic criteria** (Revised Atlanta Classification): Requires at least 2 of 3:
1. **Characteristic abdominal pain**
2. **Serum lipase (or amylase) >3× upper limit of normal**
3. **Characteristic findings on imaging** (CT, MRI, ultrasound)

**Laboratory tests**:

*Pancreatic enzymes*:
- **Lipase**: More sensitive and specific than amylase, remains elevated longer
- **Amylase**: Rises within 6-12 hours, peaks at 24 hours, normalizes in 3-5 days
- Level of elevation does NOT correlate with severity
- May be normal in chronic pancreatitis with acute flare (gland atrophy)

*Other labs*:
- **CBC**: Leukocytosis, hemoconcentration (hematocrit >44% poor prognostic sign)
- **Metabolic panel**:
  - Glucose: Hyperglycemia
  - Calcium: Hypocalcemia (severe cases, saponification)
  - Creatinine: Assess renal function
- **Liver function tests**: Elevated in biliary pancreatitis (ALT >150 U/L suggests gallstone etiology)
- **Triglycerides**: If >1000 mg/dL, likely cause
- **Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)**: Elevated in severe cases
- **Arterial blood gas**: If hypoxia, acidosis

**Imaging**:

*Abdominal ultrasound*:
- First-line imaging
- Assess for gallstones, biliary ductal dilatation
- Limited pancreatic visualization (bowel gas)
- Evaluate for complications (ascites, pleural effusion)

*Contrast-enhanced CT (CECT)*:
- **Not required for diagnosis** in typical cases
- **Indications**: Uncertain diagnosis, severe disease, no improvement after 48-72 hours, suspected complications
- **Timing**: Wait 72-96 hours after symptom onset (allows necrosis to demarcate)
- **Findings**:
  - Pancreatic enlargement, edema, peripancreatic fat stranding
  - Fluid collections
  - Necrosis: Non-enhancing pancreatic parenchyma
  - Complications: Pseudocyst, vascular thrombosis, hemorrhage

*CT Severity Index (CTSI)*:
- Grades severity based on inflammation and necrosis
- Correlates with morbidity and mortality

*MRI/MRCP*:
- Alternative to CT (no radiation, better soft tissue contrast)
- Better for bile duct visualization
- Useful if iodinated contrast contraindicated

### Chronic Pancreatitis

**Imaging**:

*CT scan*:
- **Calcifications**: Pathognomonic (present in 30-50%)
- Pancreatic atrophy
- Ductal dilatation, irregularity
- Pseudocysts
- Pancreatic/common bile duct strictures

*MRI/MRCP*:
- Visualizes pancreatic duct anatomy
- Chain-of-lakes appearance (alternating dilatation and strictures)
- Intraductal stones
- Better soft tissue resolution than CT

*Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)*:
- Most sensitive for early chronic pancreatitis
- Parenchymal and ductal criteria (Cambridge classification)
- Can guide biopsy if needed

*ERCP*:
- Gold standard for ductal anatomy
- Therapeutic role (stone removal, stricture dilation, stenting)
- Not for diagnosis alone (risk of pancreatitis)

**Functional tests**:

*Exocrine function*:
- **Fecal elastase-1**: <200 μg/g stool indicates insufficiency (non-invasive)
- **Serum trypsinogen**: Low levels (<20 ng/mL) specific for severe insufficiency
- **72-hour fecal fat**: Gold standard for steatorrhea (>7 g/day abnormal) - rarely performed
- **Secretin stimulation test**: Measures bicarbonate secretion (specialized, not widely available)

*Endocrine function*:
- Fasting glucose, HbA1c
- Oral glucose tolerance test

### Severity Assessment (Acute Pancreatitis)

**Clinical scores**:

*Ranson criteria* (at admission and 48 hours):
- At admission: Age >55, WBC >16,000, glucose >200, LDH >350, AST >250
- At 48 hours: Hematocrit drop >10%, BUN rise >5, calcium <8, PaO₂ <60, base deficit >4, fluid sequestration >6 L
- Score ≥3: Severe disease
- Limitations: Not dynamic, cannot repeat

*APACHE II*:
- Validated, widely used
- Score ≥8: Severe disease
- Can be repeated

*BISAP score* (0-5 points):
- **B**UN >25 mg/dL
- **I**mpaired mental status
- **S**IRS (≥2 criteria)
- **A**ge >60 years
- **P**leural effusion
- Score ≥3: High risk of mortality

**Predictive factors**:
- Persistent organ failure (>48 hours): Strongest predictor of mortality
- SIRS: Persistent SIRS (>48 hours) predicts severe disease
- Hemoconcentration: Hematocrit >44% at admission
- Obesity: BMI >30 associated with worse outcomes

**Revised Atlanta Classification**:
- Severity: Mild, moderately severe, severe (based on organ failure and complications)
- Organ failure: Modified Marshall score (respiratory, renal, cardiovascular)

## Treatment

### Acute Pancreatitis

**Supportive care** (cornerstone):

*Fluid resuscitation*:
- **Goal-directed therapy**: Early aggressive IV hydration (within 24 hours)
- Lactated Ringer's preferred over normal saline (may reduce SIRS, inflammation)
- Initial rate: 250-500 mL/hr for 24-48 hours
- Monitor: Urine output, heart rate, hematocrit, BUN
- Avoid overhydration (pulmonary edema, abdominal compartment syndrome)

*Pain control*:
- Opioids as needed (morphine, hydromorphone, fentanyl)
- Historically avoided morphine (sphincter of Oddi spasm concern - unfounded)
- Patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) if severe

*Nutritional support*:
- **NPO initially** only if nausea/vomiting
- **Early enteral nutrition** (within 24-48 hours) preferred if tolerated
- Oral diet: Low-fat, soft diet as tolerated (no need to wait for enzyme normalization)
- Nasogastric tube only if ileus or severe vomiting
- **Enteral > parenteral**: Reduces infection, organ failure, length of stay
- Nasojejunal feeding if unable to tolerate oral/nasogastric

*Prophylactic antibiotics*:
- **NOT recommended** routinely
- No benefit in preventing infected necrosis
- Reserve for documented infected necrosis or other infections

*Other supportive measures*:
- Oxygen supplementation (maintain SpO₂ >92%)
- DVT prophylaxis
- Monitor electrolytes, glucose (insulin if needed)
- Proton pump inhibitor (if stress ulcer risk factors)

**Treatment of underlying cause**:

*Biliary pancreatitis*:
- **Cholecystectomy**: During same admission (if mild) or after recovery (if severe)
- Timing: Preferably within 2 weeks to prevent recurrence
- **ERCP**: If acute cholangitis (urgent, within 24 hours) or persistent biliary obstruction
- ERCP NOT indicated routinely for predicted mild biliary pancreatitis

*Hypertriglyceridemic pancreatitis*:
- Insulin infusion (activates lipoprotein lipase, lowers triglycerides)
- Plasmapheresis (if severe, refractory)
- Goal: Triglycerides <500 mg/dL
- Long-term: Fibrates, omega-3 fatty acids, lifestyle modification

*Alcohol-related*:
- Alcohol cessation counseling
- Addiction treatment referral

**Management of complications**:

*Infected pancreatic necrosis*:
- Clinical suspicion: Persistent fever, leukocytosis, organ failure beyond first week
- Diagnosis: Gas in necrotic collection on CT, or FNA with Gram stain/culture
- Treatment:
  - Antibiotics: Carbapenems, fluoroquinolones (good pancreatic penetration)
  - **Delayed intervention**: Step-up approach
    - Wait 4 weeks if possible (allow walling-off, easier drainage)
    - Percutaneous catheter drainage or endoscopic drainage
    - Minimally invasive necrosectomy (percutaneous, endoscopic, video-assisted retroperitoneal)
    - Open necrosectomy (last resort)

*Pancreatic pseudocyst*:
- Definition: Fluid collection >4 weeks, encapsulated by fibrous wall
- Most resolve spontaneously (40-60%)
- Drain if: Symptomatic, infected, enlarging, complications
- Methods: Endoscopic drainage (transmural or transpapillary), percutaneous, surgical

*Abdominal compartment syndrome*:
- Intra-abdominal pressure >20 mmHg with organ dysfunction
- Treatment: Decompression (percutaneous drainage, surgical)

*Organ failure*:
- Intensive care management
- Mechanical ventilation (ARDS)
- Renal replacement therapy (AKI)
- Vasopressor support (shock)

### Chronic Pancreatitis

**Pain management**:

*Pharmacologic*:
- **Non-opioid analgesics**: Acetaminophen, NSAIDs (first-line)
- **Opioids**: Often required, risk of dependence (monitor carefully)
- **Adjuvants**: Pregabalin, gabapentin (neuropathic pain), tricyclic antidepressants
- **Pancreatic enzyme supplementation**: May reduce pain (feedback inhibition of secretion) - evidence mixed

*Endoscopic therapy*:
- **ERCP with sphincterotomy**: If sphincter of Oddi dysfunction or papillary stenosis
- **Stone extraction**: Endoscopic or lithotripsy for obstructive stones
- **Stricture dilation and stenting**: Temporary or long-term
- Success rate: 50-70% pain relief

*Surgical therapy*:
- **Indications**: Refractory pain, complications (pseudocyst, biliary/duodenal obstruction)
- **Options**:
  - Pancreaticojejunostomy (Puestow procedure): For dilated duct (>7 mm), lateral drainage
  - Pancreatic head resection: Beger (duodenum-preserving), Frey (local head resection + lateral drainage)
  - Total pancreatectomy with islet autotransplantation (TPIAT): For refractory cases
  - Distal pancreatectomy: For distal disease, pseudocyst
- Success rate: 60-80% pain relief (better than endoscopic in some studies)

*Celiac plexus block*:
- Temporary pain relief (weeks to months)
- Image-guided or EUS-guided injection
- Limited long-term efficacy

**Exocrine insufficiency**:

*Pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT)*:
- **Indications**: Steatorrhea, weight loss, fecal elastase <200
- **Formulations**: Enteric-coated microspheres or minimicrospheres (protect from gastric acid)
- **Dosing**:
  - 25,000-75,000 USP units lipase per meal
  - 10,000-25,000 USP units per snack
  - Titrate to symptom control, weight gain
- **Administration**: With meals and snacks, swallow whole (do not crush)
- **Adjunct PPI**: If inadequate response (raise duodenal pH for optimal enzyme activity)

*Fat-soluble vitamin supplementation*:
- Vitamins A, D, E, K
- Monitor levels annually

*Nutritional counseling*:
- Medium-chain triglycerides (easier to absorb)
- Small, frequent meals

**Endocrine insufficiency**:

*Diabetes management*:
- "Type 3c" diabetes (pancreatogenic)
- Insulin required in most cases
- Challenging: Deficiency of both insulin AND glucagon → risk of hypoglycemia
- Avoid sulfonylureas (hypoglycemia risk)
- Metformin, incretin-based therapies sometimes used

**Alcohol/smoking cessation**:
- Critical for slowing disease progression
- Reduces pain, complications
- Addiction counseling and support

## Complications

### Acute Pancreatitis

**Local complications**:

*Acute peripancreatic fluid collection (APFC)*:
- <4 weeks, no wall
- Most resolve spontaneously

*Pancreatic pseudocyst*:
- >4 weeks, well-defined wall
- Manage as described above

*Acute necrotic collection (ANC)*:
- <4 weeks, with necrosis
- Evolves into walled-off necrosis

*Walled-off necrosis (WON)*:
- >4 weeks, encapsulated necrotic tissue
- Higher infection risk than pseudocyst

*Infected necrosis*:
- Life-threatening
- Treatment as described above

*Vascular complications*:
- Pseudoaneurysm: Splenic, gastroduodenal, pancreaticoduodenal arteries (risk of rupture)
- Venous thrombosis: Splenic, portal, superior mesenteric veins

**Systemic complications**:
- Persistent organ failure (cardiovascular, respiratory, renal)
- ARDS
- Acute kidney injury
- DIC
- Shock
- Death

### Chronic Pancreatitis

**Complications**:
- Pancreatic pseudocyst (20-40%)
- Biliary stricture → jaundice, cholangitis (10-30%)
- Duodenal obstruction
- Pancreatic ascites/pleural effusion (duct rupture)
- Splenic vein thrombosis → isolated gastric varices
- Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (increased risk, 2-5% cumulative)
- Osteoporosis (malabsorption, smoking, alcohol)

## Prognosis

### Acute Pancreatitis

**Mortality**:
- Mild: <1%
- Moderately severe: 1-3%
- Severe with persistent organ failure: 20-40%
- Infected necrosis: 15-30%

**Recovery**:
- Mild: 1 week
- Severe: Weeks to months

**Recurrence**:
- Depends on underlying cause
- Biliary pancreatitis: High recurrence if cholecystectomy not performed
- Alcohol: Cessation reduces recurrence significantly

### Chronic Pancreatitis

**Natural history**:
- Progressive disease
- Pain severity may decrease over time ("burnout" in some)
- 50% develop diabetes within 10 years
- 30-50% require surgery

**Mortality**:
- 10-year survival: 70%
- 20-year survival: 45%
- Causes: Pancreatic cancer, complications, comorbidities (cardiovascular, alcohol-related)

**Quality of life**:
- Significantly impaired
- Chronic pain, malnutrition, diabetes
- High rates of depression, anxiety
- Opioid dependence common

## Key Points

- Acute pancreatitis is diagnosed by 2 of 3 criteria: characteristic pain, lipase/amylase >3× ULN, and characteristic imaging findings
- Gallstones and alcohol account for 70-80% of acute pancreatitis cases; always identify and treat the underlying cause
- Early aggressive IV fluid resuscitation with lactated Ringer's (250-500 mL/hr for 24 hours) is the cornerstone of treatment
- Early enteral nutrition (within 24-48 hours) is preferred over parenteral and reduces complications; prophylactic antibiotics are not recommended
- Cholecystectomy should be performed during the same admission for mild biliary pancreatitis to prevent recurrence
- Infected pancreatic necrosis requires delayed intervention (preferably >4 weeks) using a step-up approach: antibiotics → drainage → minimally invasive necrosectomy
- Chronic pancreatitis is characterized by irreversible fibrosis, calcifications, and loss of exocrine/endocrine function, most commonly due to alcohol (70-80%)
- Pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (25,000-75,000 units lipase per meal) is indicated for steatorrhea and weight loss in chronic pancreatitis
- Endoscopic therapy (stone removal, stricture dilation) and surgery (Puestow, Frey, Beger procedures) are options for refractory pain in chronic pancreatitis
- Patients with chronic pancreatitis have increased risk of pancreatic cancer and require vigilance for concerning symptoms
