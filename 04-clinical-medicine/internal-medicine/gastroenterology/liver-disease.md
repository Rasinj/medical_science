# Liver Disease

## Overview

Liver disease encompasses a broad spectrum of disorders affecting hepatic structure and function, ranging from acute hepatitis to chronic cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. The liver's central role in metabolism, detoxification, and synthesis makes liver disease a significant cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide.

### Major Categories

**Acute liver disease**:
- Viral hepatitis (A, B, C, D, E)
- Drug-induced liver injury (DILI)
- Acute alcoholic hepatitis
- Ischemic hepatitis
- Acute fatty liver of pregnancy

**Chronic liver disease**:
- Chronic viral hepatitis (B, C)
- Alcohol-related liver disease
- Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD/NASH)
- Autoimmune hepatitis
- Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC)
- Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC)
- Hereditary hemochromatosis
- Wilson's disease
- Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency

**End-stage liver disease**:
- Cirrhosis (compensated and decompensated)
- Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)
- Acute-on-chronic liver failure

### Epidemiology

**Global burden**:
- Chronic liver disease affects ~1.5 billion people worldwide
- 11th leading cause of death globally
- 2 million deaths annually (1 million from cirrhosis, 1 million from viral hepatitis and HCC)

**United States**:
- Chronic liver disease: 12th leading cause of death
- NAFLD: Affects 25-30% of population (most common)
- Alcohol-related liver disease: 2nd most common
- Viral hepatitis: HCV affects 2.4 million, HBV affects 850,000

**Demographics**:
- Cirrhosis mortality: Highest in ages 45-65
- Male predominance in most liver diseases
- Geographic variation based on etiology (HBV endemic in Asia, HCV in Egypt)

## Pathophysiology

### Normal Liver Function

**Synthetic functions**:
- Albumin, clotting factors (II, VII, IX, X), complement
- Bile acids and bile production
- Cholesterol synthesis

**Metabolic functions**:
- Glucose homeostasis (glycogenolysis, gluconeogenesis)
- Protein metabolism (urea cycle)
- Lipid metabolism
- Drug and toxin metabolism (cytochrome P450 system)
- Bilirubin conjugation and excretion

**Immunologic functions**:
- Kupffer cells (macrophages) clear pathogens, endotoxins
- Innate and adaptive immunity

### Mechanisms of Liver Injury

**Hepatocellular injury**:
- Direct cytotoxicity (alcohol, drugs, viruses)
- Immune-mediated (autoimmune hepatitis, viral hepatitis)
- Oxidative stress and lipotoxicity (NAFLD/NASH)
- Mitochondrial dysfunction
- Apoptosis and necrosis

**Cholestatic injury**:
- Bile duct damage (PBC, PSC)
- Impaired bile flow (intrahepatic or extrahepatic obstruction)
- Bile acid accumulation causing hepatocyte injury

**Vascular injury**:
- Ischemia (shock liver, Budd-Chiari syndrome)
- Sinusoidal obstruction syndrome
- Portal vein thrombosis

### Progression to Cirrhosis

**Fibrosis**:
- Chronic injury → inflammation
- Hepatic stellate cell activation
- Extracellular matrix deposition (collagen)
- Progressive replacement of normal architecture

**Cirrhosis**:
- End-stage fibrosis with nodular regeneration
- Disrupted hepatic architecture
- Loss of hepatocyte function
- Portal hypertension
- Irreversible (but early stages may regress with treatment)

## Cirrhosis

### Definition and Classification

**Definition**: Histologic diagnosis characterized by bridging fibrosis and nodular regenerative changes resulting in disrupted hepatic architecture

**Etiology** (United States):
- NAFLD/NASH: 25-30% (increasing)
- Alcohol: 25-30%
- Hepatitis C: 20-25% (declining with treatment)
- Hepatitis B: 5-10%
- Other: Autoimmune, PBC, PSC, hemochromatosis, Wilson's, alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, cryptogenic

**Classification**:
- **Compensated cirrhosis**: Normal or mildly abnormal liver function, no complications
- **Decompensated cirrhosis**: Development of ascites, variceal bleeding, encephalopathy, or jaundice
- Child-Pugh score: Grades severity (A, B, C) based on bilirubin, albumin, INR, ascites, encephalopathy
- MELD score: Predicts 3-month mortality, used for transplant allocation

### Clinical Presentation

**Compensated cirrhosis**:
- Often asymptomatic
- Detected incidentally (imaging, labs)
- Nonspecific symptoms: Fatigue, weakness

**Physical signs**:
- **Cutaneous**: Spider angiomas (telangiectasias on upper body), palmar erythema, jaundice
- **Endocrine**: Gynecomastia, testicular atrophy, loss of body hair (males)
- **Abdominal**: Hepatomegaly (early) or small, nodular liver (late), splenomegaly (portal hypertension), ascites, caput medusae (dilated periumbilical veins)
- **Other**: Muscle wasting, clubbing, Dupuytren's contracture (alcohol), parotid enlargement (alcohol)

**Decompensated cirrhosis** - Manifestations:
- Ascites (most common)
- Variceal bleeding
- Hepatic encephalopathy
- Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis
- Hepatorenal syndrome
- Jaundice

### Diagnosis

**Laboratory findings**:
- Thrombocytopenia (platelet count <150,000, most sensitive early finding)
- Anemia (chronic disease, hypersplenism, GI bleeding)
- Leukopenia (hypersplenism)
- Elevated INR (impaired synthesis of clotting factors)
- Hypoalbuminemia (impaired synthesis)
- Elevated bilirubin (impaired conjugation/excretion)
- Transaminases: Variable elevation (ALT, AST)
- Elevated alkaline phosphatase (cholestatic diseases)
- Hyponatremia (dilutional)

**Imaging**:
- **Ultrasound**: Nodular liver contour, coarse echotexture, splenomegaly, ascites, portosystemic collaterals
- **CT/MRI**: Better characterization, assess for HCC screening, hepatic/portal vein patency
- **Elastography** (FibroScan): Non-invasive assessment of liver stiffness, correlates with fibrosis stage

**Liver biopsy**:
- Gold standard for diagnosis and staging
- Not always required if clinical/radiologic evidence clear
- Indications: Uncertain etiology, assess activity and stage, evaluate for HCC
- Complications: Bleeding, pain, infection

**Endoscopy**:
- Screen for esophageal varices (EGD) at diagnosis of cirrhosis
- Repeat every 1-3 years depending on size

### Complications

**Portal hypertension**:

*Definition*: Elevated portal venous pressure (>10-12 mmHg)

*Pathophysiology*:
- Increased resistance: Architectural distortion, vasoconstriction
- Increased flow: Splanchnic vasodilation

*Consequences*:
- Varices: Esophageal, gastric, anorectal
- Splenomegaly, hypersplenism (cytopenias)
- Ascites
- Portosystemic encephalopathy
- Hepatopulmonary syndrome
- Portopulmonary hypertension

**Ascites**:

*Pathophysiology*:
- Portal hypertension + splanchnic vasodilation → RAAS activation → sodium and water retention
- Hypoalbuminemia reduces oncotic pressure

*Clinical presentation*:
- Abdominal distention, weight gain
- Shifting dullness, fluid wave on examination
- Dyspnea (if tense), early satiety

*Diagnosis*:
- Ultrasound confirms fluid
- **Diagnostic paracentesis**: Always perform with new-onset ascites
- Ascitic fluid analysis:
  - Cell count and differential
  - Albumin (calculate SAAG = serum albumin - ascites albumin)
  - Total protein
  - Culture (blood culture bottles, 10 mL)
  - Gram stain, cytology (if indicated)

*Serum-ascites albumin gradient (SAAG)*:
- SAAG ≥1.1 g/dL: Portal hypertension (cirrhosis, cardiac, Budd-Chiari)
- SAAG <1.1 g/dL: Non-portal hypertension causes (peritoneal carcinomatosis, TB peritonitis, pancreatitis, nephrotic syndrome)

*Treatment*:
- Sodium restriction: <2 g/day
- Diuretics:
  - Spironolactone 50-200 mg daily + furosemide 20-80 mg daily (maintain 100:40 ratio)
  - Monitor weight loss (goal 0.5 kg/day if no edema, 1 kg/day if peripheral edema)
  - Monitor electrolytes, renal function
- Large-volume paracentesis: If tense ascites or refractory
  - Remove 4-5 liters, albumin replacement (6-8 g per liter removed if >5 L)
- Refractory ascites:
  - TIPS (transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt)
  - Liver transplantation

**Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP)**:

*Definition*: Infection of ascitic fluid without intra-abdominal source

*Pathogenesis*:
- Bacterial translocation from gut
- Impaired immune function
- Common organisms: E. coli, Klebsiella, Streptococcus

*Clinical presentation*:
- Fever, abdominal pain, altered mental status
- May be asymptomatic or subtle

*Diagnosis*:
- Diagnostic paracentesis
- Ascites PMN count ≥250 cells/μL (diagnostic)
- Positive culture (60-80% of cases)

*Treatment*:
- Empiric antibiotics: Cefotaxime 2 g IV q8h or ceftriaxone 2 g IV daily for 5 days
- Albumin infusion: 1.5 g/kg on day 1, 1 g/kg on day 3 (reduces renal dysfunction, mortality)
- Repeat paracentesis at 48 hours to confirm response

*Prophylaxis*:
- Primary: Ciprofloxacin 500 mg daily or norfloxacin 400 mg daily (if ascitic protein <1.5 g/dL and advanced cirrhosis)
- Secondary: After SBP episode, lifelong prophylaxis (norfloxacin 400 mg daily)

**Hepatic encephalopathy (HE)**:

*Definition*: Neuropsychiatric syndrome in patients with liver dysfunction

*Pathophysiology*:
- Ammonia and other toxins (from gut bacteria) not cleared by liver
- Cross blood-brain barrier → astrocyte swelling, altered neurotransmission
- Precipitating factors: GI bleeding, infection, dehydration, constipation, medications (sedatives, opioids), electrolyte abnormalities

*Grading (West Haven criteria)*:
- Grade 0 (minimal HE): Subtle cognitive deficits on testing
- Grade 1: Altered sleep, mild confusion, irritability
- Grade 2: Lethargy, disorientation, inappropriate behavior
- Grade 3: Somnolent but arousable, gross disorientation
- Grade 4: Coma

*Clinical features*:
- Altered mental status, confusion
- Asterixis (flapping tremor)
- Hyperreflexia, rigidity
- Fetor hepaticus (musty odor)

*Diagnosis*:
- Clinical diagnosis
- Exclude other causes: Intracranial pathology, infection, metabolic
- Elevated ammonia supports diagnosis (but level does not correlate with severity)

*Treatment*:
- Identify and treat precipitating factors
- **Lactulose**: 15-30 mL PO 2-4 times daily, titrate to 2-3 soft bowel movements per day
  - Reduces ammonia absorption, promotes excretion
- **Rifaximin**: 550 mg PO BID (in combination with lactulose for recurrent HE)
  - Reduces ammonia-producing gut bacteria
- Avoid sedatives, hepatotoxic drugs
- Nutritional support: Adequate protein intake (1-1.5 g/kg/day), avoid protein restriction

**Variceal bleeding**:

*Pathophysiology*:
- Portal hypertension → portosystemic collaterals (varices)
- Varices at risk of rupture (high pressure, large size, red signs)
- High mortality (15-20% at 6 weeks)

*Presentation*:
- Hematemesis, melena
- Hypovolemic shock

*Management*:
- Resuscitation: IV access, crystalloid, blood products (target Hgb 7-9 g/dL)
- Airway protection (if altered mental status)
- **Pharmacotherapy**:
  - Octreotide 50 μg bolus, then 50 μg/hr infusion (splanchnic vasoconstriction)
  - Start before endoscopy, continue 2-5 days
- **Antibiotics**: Ceftriaxone 1 g daily (prevents infection, reduces rebleeding, mortality)
- **Urgent endoscopy** (within 12 hours):
  - Esophageal varices: Endoscopic variceal ligation (EVL) preferred, or sclerotherapy
  - Gastric varices: Cyanoacrylate injection or TIPS
- If uncontrolled bleeding: TIPS, balloon tamponade (bridge to TIPS), salvage shunt surgery
- Post-bleeding care: Beta-blocker (propranolol or carvedilol) for secondary prophylaxis, repeat EVL

*Primary prophylaxis* (no prior bleeding):
- Non-selective beta-blockers (propranolol, nadolol, carvedilol): Reduce portal pressure, bleeding risk
- EVL: Alternative for medium/large varices if beta-blockers contraindicated
- Screening: EGD at diagnosis, repeat based on varix size

**Hepatorenal syndrome (HRS)**:

*Definition*: Functional renal failure in patients with advanced cirrhosis and ascites

*Types*:
- HRS-1 (HRS-AKI): Rapid decline in renal function (doubling of Cr to >2.5 mg/dL in <2 weeks)
- HRS-2 (HRS-CKD): Slower, progressive renal dysfunction

*Pathophysiology*:
- Severe splanchnic vasodilation → renal vasoconstriction (RAAS, sympathetic activation)
- Reduced renal perfusion without structural kidney damage

*Diagnosis (revised criteria)*:
- Cirrhosis with ascites
- AKI: Increase in Cr ≥0.3 mg/dL in 48 hours or ≥50% from baseline
- No response to diuretic withdrawal and volume expansion (albumin 1 g/kg for 2 days)
- Absence of shock, nephrotoxic drugs, parenchymal kidney disease (proteinuria, hematuria, abnormal ultrasound)

*Treatment*:
- **Vasoconstrictors + albumin**:
  - Preferred: Norepinephrine (in ICU setting) or midodrine + octreotide
  - Albumin 1 g/kg on day 1, then 20-40 g daily
  - Continue until Cr normalizes or no response after 14 days
- **TIPS**: May improve renal function
- **Liver transplantation**: Definitive treatment
- Dialysis: Bridge to transplant (not effective alone)

*Prognosis*:
- HRS-1: Median survival 2 weeks without treatment
- HRS-2: Median survival 6 months

**Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)**: (See separate section below)

## Chronic Viral Hepatitis

### Hepatitis B

**Virology**:
- DNA virus, Hepadnaviridae family
- Transmitted: Blood, sexual contact, perinatal

**Epidemiology**:
- 296 million chronic HBV worldwide
- 820,000 deaths annually
- Endemic in Asia, Africa

**Clinical phases**:
- Immune-tolerant: High HBV DNA, normal ALT, minimal inflammation
- Immune-active: Elevated ALT, active inflammation, fibrosis progression
- Inactive carrier: Low HBV DNA, normal ALT, HBeAg-negative
- HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis: HBeAg-negative, elevated ALT, active disease

**Diagnosis**:
- **HBsAg**: Chronic infection if positive >6 months
- **Anti-HBc**: Exposure (IgM = acute, IgG = past or chronic)
- **Anti-HBs**: Immunity (vaccination or resolved infection)
- **HBeAg/Anti-HBe**: Viral replication status
- **HBV DNA**: Quantitative viral load

**Treatment**:
- Indications: HBV DNA >2000 IU/mL, elevated ALT, significant fibrosis/cirrhosis
- **Nucleos(t)ide analogs**: Tenofovir or entecavir (first-line)
  - Suppresses viral replication
  - Daily oral medication, generally lifelong
  - Monitor HBV DNA, ALT, HBsAg
- **Pegylated interferon**: Alternative (finite duration, lower efficacy, more side effects)
- Goals: Suppress HBV DNA, normalize ALT, prevent cirrhosis/HCC

**Monitoring**:
- Cirrhotic patients: HCC surveillance (ultrasound ± AFP every 6 months)

### Hepatitis C

**Virology**:
- RNA virus, Flaviviridae family
- Transmitted: Blood exposure (IVDU, transfusion, needlestick)
- Genotypes 1-6

**Epidemiology**:
- 58 million chronic HCV worldwide
- 290,000 deaths annually
- Baby boomer cohort (born 1945-1965) most affected in US

**Natural history**:
- 15-45% spontaneous clearance
- 55-85% develop chronic infection
- 20-30% progress to cirrhosis over 20-30 years

**Diagnosis**:
- **Anti-HCV antibody**: Screening test (exposure)
- **HCV RNA**: Confirms active infection (qualitative or quantitative)
- **HCV genotype**: Guides treatment (less important with modern DAAs)

**Treatment**:
- **Direct-acting antivirals (DAAs)**: Pan-genotypic regimens
  - Examples: Sofosbuvir/velpatasvir, glecaprevir/pibrentasvir, sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir
  - Treatment duration: 8-12 weeks
  - SVR (sustained virologic response) rates: >95%
  - SVR = cure (undetectable HCV RNA 12 weeks after treatment)
- Indications: All patients with chronic HCV (except limited life expectancy)
- Post-treatment: Check HCV RNA at 12 weeks (SVR12), monitor for HCC if cirrhosis

## Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD)

### Definition and Spectrum

**NAFLD**: Hepatic steatosis (>5% hepatocytes) in absence of significant alcohol use (<20 g/day women, <30 g/day men) or other causes

**Spectrum**:
- **NAFL**: Simple steatosis without significant inflammation
- **NASH** (Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis): Steatosis + inflammation + hepatocyte ballooning ± fibrosis
- **Cirrhosis**: End-stage NASH

### Epidemiology

- Prevalence: 25-30% globally (parallel with obesity epidemic)
- NASH: 3-5% of population
- Most common cause of liver disease in Western countries
- Associated with metabolic syndrome

### Pathophysiology

**"Two-hit" hypothesis** (now "multiple-hit"):
- First hit: Insulin resistance → hepatic steatosis (lipid accumulation)
- Additional hits: Oxidative stress, lipotoxicity, inflammation, gut dysbiosis → NASH, fibrosis

**Risk factors**:
- Obesity (especially visceral adiposity)
- Type 2 diabetes mellitus
- Dyslipidemia (high triglycerides, low HDL)
- Metabolic syndrome
- Hispanic ethnicity (PNPLA3 genetic variant)

### Clinical Presentation

**Symptoms**:
- Usually asymptomatic
- Fatigue, vague RUQ discomfort (if advanced)

**Physical examination**:
- Hepatomegaly
- Features of metabolic syndrome: Obesity, acanthosis nigricans
- Stigmata of cirrhosis (if advanced)

### Diagnosis

**Laboratory**:
- Elevated transaminases (ALT > AST typically, ratio may reverse in cirrhosis)
- Often normal ALT despite significant disease
- Rule out other causes: Viral hepatitis, autoimmune, hemochromatosis, Wilson's, alcohol

**Imaging**:
- **Ultrasound**: Hepatic steatosis (echogenic liver)
- **CT/MRI**: Quantify steatosis
- **Elastography** (FibroScan): Assess fibrosis (CAP score measures steatosis)

**Liver biopsy**:
- Gold standard to distinguish NAFL from NASH, stage fibrosis
- Not routinely required
- Indications: Uncertainty, risk stratification, assess competing etiologies

**Non-invasive fibrosis assessment**:
- APRI, FIB-4 scores (calculate from labs)
- Elastography
- Avoid biopsy if low probability of advanced fibrosis

### Treatment

**No FDA-approved medications** (as of current guidelines)

**Lifestyle modification** (cornerstone):
- Weight loss: 7-10% body weight improves steatosis, inflammation, fibrosis
- Diet: Mediterranean diet, reduced refined carbohydrates
- Exercise: 150-200 minutes/week moderate-intensity aerobic exercise
- Avoid alcohol

**Treat metabolic risk factors**:
- Diabetes control: Metformin, pioglitazone (improves NASH), GLP-1 agonists, SGLT2 inhibitors
- Dyslipidemia: Statins (safe in NAFLD)
- Hypertension: Standard agents

**Investigational therapies**:
- Vitamin E: 800 IU daily (improves NASH in non-diabetic patients, some concerns about long-term safety)
- Pioglitazone: Improves NASH and fibrosis (weight gain, edema, bone loss side effects)
- GLP-1 receptor agonists: Weight loss, metabolic benefits, potential histologic improvement

**Bariatric surgery**:
- Consider if obesity and NASH
- Effective for weight loss, improves/resolves NASH

**Advanced disease**:
- Cirrhosis: Treat complications, transplant evaluation
- HCC surveillance (as per cirrhosis guidelines)

### Prognosis

- NAFL: Benign course, low progression
- NASH: 20-30% progress to cirrhosis over 10-20 years
- Fibrosis stage strongest predictor of outcomes
- Cardiovascular disease is leading cause of death (not liver-related)

## Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC)

### Epidemiology

- 6th most common cancer worldwide, 3rd leading cause of cancer death
- 800,000 new cases, 700,000 deaths annually
- Incidence rising in US (HCV, NAFLD)
- Male predominance (2-4:1)

### Risk Factors

**Major**:
- Cirrhosis (any etiology): 80-90% of HCC
  - HCV cirrhosis: 3-5% per year
  - HBV cirrhosis: 2-5% per year
  - Alcohol cirrhosis: 1-2% per year
  - NAFLD cirrhosis: 0.5-2.6% per year
- Chronic HBV (even without cirrhosis)

**Other**:
- Aflatoxin exposure (Asia, Africa)
- Smoking, diabetes, obesity
- Hemochromatosis, alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency

### Pathophysiology

- Chronic inflammation → hepatocyte turnover → genetic mutations
- Dysplastic nodules → HCC
- Key pathways: p53, Wnt/β-catenin, telomerase

### Clinical Presentation

**Early stage**:
- Often asymptomatic
- Detected on surveillance imaging

**Advanced stage**:
- RUQ pain
- Weight loss, anorexia
- Hepatomegaly, palpable mass
- Worsening liver function (jaundice, ascites, encephalopathy)
- Paraneoplastic: Hypoglycemia, erythrocytosis, hypercalcemia

### Diagnosis

**Surveillance** (at-risk patients):
- Ultrasound ± AFP every 6 months
- Populations: Cirrhosis (any cause), chronic HBV (Asian males >40, Asian females >50, Africans >20, family history HCC, or cirrhosis)

**Diagnostic imaging** (if lesion detected):
- **Multiphasic CT or MRI** (arterial, portal venous, delayed phases)
- HCC characteristics:
  - Arterial hyperenhancement (arterial phase)
  - Washout (portal venous/delayed phase)
  - Capsule appearance
- LI-RADS (Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System) classification

**Biopsy**:
- Not required if imaging diagnostic (typical enhancement pattern, lesion >1 cm)
- Indicated if atypical features or non-cirrhotic liver
- Risk of tumor seeding (rare)

**AFP** (alpha-fetoprotein):
- Tumor marker, elevated in 50-70% of HCC
- Not specific or sensitive enough for diagnosis alone
- Used for surveillance and prognosis

### Staging

**Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) staging**:
- Incorporates tumor burden, liver function, performance status
- Guides treatment approach
- Stages: 0 (very early), A (early), B (intermediate), C (advanced), D (terminal)

**Milan criteria** (transplant eligibility):
- Single tumor ≤5 cm, or
- Up to 3 tumors, each ≤3 cm
- No macrovascular invasion, no extrahepatic spread

### Treatment

**Very early/early stage (BCLC 0, A)**:
- **Surgical resection**: Curative intent, for non-cirrhotic or compensated cirrhosis (Child-Pugh A) with solitary tumor and no portal hypertension
- **Liver transplantation**: Curative, for cirrhotic patients within Milan criteria (best long-term survival, treats HCC and cirrhosis)
- **Ablation**: Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) or microwave ablation (MWA) for tumors <3 cm, not amenable to resection

**Intermediate stage (BCLC B)**:
- **Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE)**: Catheter-directed chemotherapy + embolization, palliative, multiple sessions

**Advanced stage (BCLC C)**:
- **Systemic therapy**:
  - First-line: Atezolizumab (anti-PD-L1) + bevacizumab (anti-VEGF)
  - Alternatives: Sorafenib, lenvatinib (tyrosine kinase inhibitors)
  - Second-line: Regorafenib, cabozantinib, ramucirumab

**Terminal stage (BCLC D)**:
- **Best supportive care**

**Locoregional therapies** (bridge to transplant, downstaging):
- TACE, ablation, TARE (transarterial radioembolization/Y90)

### Prognosis

**5-year survival**:
- Resection: 50-70%
- Transplant: 60-80%
- Ablation: 40-70%
- TACE: 20-30%
- Systemic therapy: Median survival 13-19 months
- Untreated advanced HCC: <1 year

## Key Points

- Cirrhosis is the end-stage of chronic liver disease characterized by fibrosis, architectural distortion, and nodular regeneration with major complications including portal hypertension, ascites, variceal bleeding, and encephalopathy
- NAFLD affects 25-30% of the population and is the most common cause of liver disease in Western countries, with NASH potentially progressing to cirrhosis and HCC
- Chronic HCV is curable with direct-acting antivirals achieving >95% SVR rates; all patients with chronic HCV should be treated
- Chronic HBV requires lifelong treatment with tenofovir or entecavir in patients with active disease or cirrhosis
