# Chronic Kidney Disease

## Overview

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is defined as abnormalities of kidney structure or function present for more than 3 months with implications for health. CKD is a global public health problem affecting approximately 15% of the US population and is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and premature death.

### Definition

**KDIGO criteria** (either present for >3 months):
1. **GFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m²**, OR
2. **Markers of kidney damage** (one or more):
   - Albuminuria (AER ≥30 mg/24hr or ACR ≥30 mg/g)
   - Urine sediment abnormalities
   - Electrolyte abnormalities due to tubular disorders
   - Abnormalities detected by histology
   - Structural abnormalities detected by imaging
   - History of kidney transplantation

### CKD Staging

**Stage by eGFR (G category)**:
- **G1**: eGFR ≥90 mL/min/1.73 m² (normal or high, with kidney damage)
- **G2**: eGFR 60-89 mL/min/1.73 m² (mildly decreased, with kidney damage)
- **G3a**: eGFR 45-59 mL/min/1.73 m² (mildly to moderately decreased)
- **G3b**: eGFR 30-44 mL/min/1.73 m² (moderately to severely decreased)
- **G4**: eGFR 15-29 mL/min/1.73 m² (severely decreased)
- **G5**: eGFR <15 mL/min/1.73 m² (kidney failure)

**Stage by albuminuria (A category)**:
- **A1**: <30 mg/g or <30 mg/24hr (normal to mildly increased)
- **A2**: 30-300 mg/g or 30-300 mg/24hr (moderately increased)
- **A3**: >300 mg/g or >300 mg/24hr (severely increased)

**Risk stratification**: Combination of G and A categories predicts outcomes

### Epidemiology

**Prevalence**:
- United States: 37 million adults (~15% of population)
- Stage 1-2: 2-3%
- Stage 3: 7-8%
- Stage 4: 0.4%
- Stage 5 (ESRD): 0.2% (>750,000 on dialysis or transplant)

**Incidence**:
- ESRD: ~130,000 new cases annually in US
- Increasing prevalence worldwide (aging population, diabetes, hypertension epidemics)

**Causes** (US):
- Diabetes mellitus: 38-40% (most common)
- Hypertension: 26-28%
- Glomerulonephritis: 10-12%
- Polycystic kidney disease: 3-5%
- Other: Obstructive uropathy, chronic interstitial nephritis, unknown

**Demographics**:
- More common with increasing age
- Higher prevalence in African Americans, Hispanics, Native Americans
- Males > females

**Outcomes**:
- Cardiovascular disease: Leading cause of death in CKD
- Progression to ESRD: Higher stage, higher albuminuria → greater risk
- 5-year mortality: Higher than many cancers
- ESRD on dialysis: 5-year survival ~35%

## Pathophysiology

### Mechanisms of Progression

**Initial injury** (diabetes, hypertension, glomerulonephritis, etc.) → **Loss of nephrons** → **Adaptive hyperfiltration in remaining nephrons**:
- Glomerular hypertension (increased intraglomerular pressure)
- Glomerular hypertrophy
- Initially maintains GFR

**Maladaptive changes**:
- Proteinuria (damaged filtration barrier)
- Tubular injury from proteinuria
- Activation of RAAS
- Oxidative stress, inflammation
- Progressive glomerulosclerosis and tubulointerstitial fibrosis
- Further nephron loss → vicious cycle

**Hemodynamic factors**:
- Systemic hypertension
- Glomerular hypertension (angiotensin II-mediated efferent arteriolar constriction)
- Hyperfiltration

**Metabolic factors**:
- Hyperglycemia (diabetes): AGE formation, oxidative stress
- Dyslipidemia
- Metabolic acidosis

**Inflammatory and fibrotic factors**:
- TGF-β, angiotensin II, aldosterone
- Podocyte injury
- Epithelial-mesenchymal transition
- Collagen deposition

### Uremic Syndrome

As GFR declines, accumulation of uremic toxins:
- Small molecules: Urea, creatinine, uric acid
- Middle molecules: β2-microglobulin, parathyroid hormone
- Protein-bound: Indoxyl sulfate, p-cresol sulfate

**Effects**:
- Anemia (reduced erythropoietin)
- Mineral and bone disorder
- Metabolic acidosis
- Cardiovascular disease (LVH, accelerated atherosclerosis, calcification)
- Malnutrition, sarcopenia
- Immune dysfunction
- Cognitive impairment
- Uremic symptoms (nausea, pruritus, neuropathy)

## Clinical Presentation

### Symptoms

**Early stages (G1-G3a)**: Often asymptomatic
- Detected by routine labs or screening

**Moderate stages (G3b-G4)**:
- Fatigue, weakness
- Decreased appetite
- Sleep disturbances
- Difficulty concentrating
- Nocturia, polyuria (loss of concentrating ability)
- Hypertension
- Edema

**Advanced stages (G4-G5)**:
- Severe fatigue
- Nausea, vomiting
- Anorexia, weight loss, muscle wasting
- Pruritus (uremic)
- Restless legs syndrome
- Metallic taste
- Cognitive impairment
- Peripheral neuropathy
- Dyspnea (volume overload, metabolic acidosis)
- Easy bruising

**Uremic syndrome** (severe, untreated G5):
- Pericarditis (uremic pericarditis)
- Encephalopathy (confusion, asterixis, seizures)
- Bleeding diathesis (platelet dysfunction)

### Physical Examination

**General**:
- Pallor (anemia)
- Uremic fetor (ammonia breath odor)
- Asterixis (uremic encephalopathy)
- Cachexia (advanced disease)

**Cardiovascular**:
- Hypertension
- Volume overload: Edema, JVD, pulmonary rales, S3 gallop
- Pericardial friction rub (uremic pericarditis)
- Signs of LVH

**Skin**:
- Dry skin, excoriations (pruritus)
- Uremic frost (rare, severe uremia)
- Bruising
- Hyperpigmentation

**Neurologic**:
- Peripheral neuropathy (stocking-glove distribution)
- Restlessness, altered mental status

**Musculoskeletal**:
- Muscle wasting
- Bone pain, fractures (renal osteodystrophy)

**Other**:
- Presence of dialysis access (AVF, AVG, catheter)

## Diagnosis

### Assessment of Kidney Function

**Serum creatinine**:
- Marker of GFR, but insensitive (may not rise until 50% GFR loss)
- Affected by muscle mass, age, sex, diet

**Estimated GFR (eGFR)**:
- Calculated from creatinine using equations (CKD-EPI most accurate)
- CKD-EPI equation accounts for age, sex, race
- More accurate than creatinine alone
- Limitations: Inaccurate in extremes of muscle mass, acute changes in GFR

**Cystatin C**:
- Alternative marker, not affected by muscle mass
- More expensive, not routinely used
- Can be combined with creatinine for improved eGFR estimation

**Urinalysis**:
- Proteinuria, hematuria, cellular casts
- Helps identify underlying cause

**Urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR)**:
- More sensitive than dipstick for albuminuria
- Preferred screening test
- Repeat to confirm (2 of 3 samples over 3 months)

**24-hour urine collection**:
- Gold standard for proteinuria quantification
- Measures creatinine clearance (approximates GFR)
- Cumbersome, prone to collection errors

### Identify Underlying Cause

**History**:
- Diabetes, hypertension
- Family history (APCKD, Alport syndrome)
- Medications, toxins
- Recurrent UTIs, stones
- Autoimmune diseases

**Laboratory tests**:
- Hemoglobin A1c (diabetes)
- Fasting glucose
- Lipid panel
- Serologies if glomerulonephritis suspected (ANA, ANCA, anti-GBM, complement, cryoglobulins, hepatitis B/C, HIV)
- Serum protein electrophoresis, urine protein electrophoresis (if monoclonal gammopathy suspected)

**Imaging**:
- Renal ultrasound:
  - Kidney size: Small (<9 cm) suggests chronicity; normal/large in diabetes, APCKD, HIV nephropathy, amyloidosis
  - Echogenicity: Increased suggests chronic changes
  - Cysts, masses
  - Obstruction

- CT or MRI: Further characterization if ultrasound abnormal

**Kidney biopsy**:
- If diagnosis uncertain and would change management
- Indications: Unexplained CKD with normal-sized kidneys, nephrotic-range proteinuria, rapidly progressive CKD, systemic disease with renal involvement
- Relative contraindications: Small kidneys (<9 cm), uncontrolled hypertension, bleeding diathesis, bilateral small kidneys usually not biopsied (unlikely to yield actionable information)

### Assess for Complications

**Complete blood count**: Anemia
**Basic metabolic panel**: Electrolytes, acidosis
**Calcium, phosphate, PTH, vitamin D**: Mineral metabolism
**Lipid panel**: Dyslipidemia
**Albumin**: Nutritional status

## Treatment

### Goals

1. **Slow progression of CKD**
2. **Treat complications** (anemia, bone disease, acidosis)
3. **Reduce cardiovascular risk**
4. **Prepare for renal replacement therapy** (if progressing)

### Slow Progression

**Blood pressure control**:
- **Target BP**: <130/80 mmHg for most CKD patients
- <120/80 mmHg if albuminuria >300 mg/g (A3 category)
- Reduces progression, cardiovascular risk

**RAAS inhibition**:
- **ACE inhibitors** or **ARBs**: First-line for CKD with albuminuria or diabetes
- Reduce proteinuria, slow progression
- Dose: Titrate to maximum tolerated
- Monitor: Creatinine (acceptable to increase up to 30%), potassium (hold if K >5.5)
- Contraindications: Bilateral renal artery stenosis, pregnancy, history of angioedema

**SGLT2 inhibitors**:
- **Dapagliflozin, empagliflozin**: Proven to slow CKD progression and reduce cardiovascular events
- Indicated for CKD with or without diabetes (eGFR ≥20 mL/min)
- Additional benefits: Reduce HF hospitalization, cardiovascular death
- Side effects: Genital infections, volume depletion

**GLP-1 receptor agonists**:
- Reduce albuminuria, slow progression in diabetic kidney disease
- Additional cardiovascular and weight loss benefits

**Glycemic control (in diabetes)**:
- HbA1c target: <7% (individualize)
- Reduces microvascular complications (including nephropathy)
- Avoid hypoglycemia (adjust diabetes medications as eGFR declines)

**Dietary modifications**:
- Sodium restriction: <2 g/day (reduces BP, proteinuria)
- Protein intake: 0.8 g/kg/day (may slow progression, controversial)
- Potassium restriction (if hyperkalemia)
- Phosphate restriction (Stage 4-5)

**Lifestyle**:
- Smoking cessation
- Weight loss if obese
- Regular exercise

**Avoid nephrotoxins**:
- NSAIDs (reduce use, avoid if possible)
- Contrast agents (minimize exposure, pre-hydrate)
- Aminoglycosides
- Proton pump inhibitors (if not indicated)

### Treat Complications

**Anemia**:

*Definition*: Hemoglobin <13 g/dL (males), <12 g/dL (females)
*Common in CKD (especially G4-G5)*: Due to reduced erythropoietin production

*Workup*:
- Rule out other causes: Iron deficiency (ferritin, TSAT), blood loss, hemolysis, B12/folate deficiency
- Check iron stores: Ferritin >100 ng/mL, TSAT >20% before ESA

*Treatment*:
- **Iron supplementation**:
  - Oral iron (if not on dialysis): Ferrous sulfate 325 mg TID
  - IV iron (if on dialysis or not tolerating oral): Iron sucrose, ferric gluconate
  - Target ferritin 100-500 ng/mL, TSAT 20-50%
- **Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs)**:
  - Epoetin alfa, darbepoetin alfa
  - Indications: Hgb <10 g/dL with adequate iron stores
  - Target Hgb: 10-11.5 g/dL (avoid >11.5, increased cardiovascular risk)
  - Monitor: Hgb monthly, adjust dose

**CKD-Mineral and Bone Disorder (CKD-MBD)**:

*Pathophysiology*:
- Reduced phosphate excretion → hyperphosphatemia
- Reduced 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (active vitamin D) → hypocalcemia
- Secondary hyperparathyroidism (PTH elevation)
- Consequences: Renal osteodystrophy, vascular calcification, fractures

*Monitoring*:
- Stage G3: PTH, calcium, phosphate annually
- Stage G4-G5: Every 3-6 months

*Treatment*:
- **Dietary phosphate restriction**: <800-1000 mg/day
- **Phosphate binders** (if hyperphosphatemia):
  - Calcium-based: Calcium acetate, calcium carbonate (with meals)
  - Non-calcium-based: Sevelamer, lanthanum (if vascular calcification concern)
  - Target phosphate: 3.5-5.5 mg/dL (G3-G4), 3.5-4.5 mg/dL (G5)
- **Vitamin D supplementation**:
  - Ergocalciferol or cholecalciferol if 25-hydroxyvitamin D <30 ng/mL
  - Active vitamin D (calcitriol, paricalcitol) if secondary hyperparathyroidism despite replete 25-OH-D
- **Calcimimetics** (cinacalcet):
  - If severe secondary hyperparathyroidism (PTH >600-800 pg/mL) on dialysis
  - Lowers PTH by increasing sensitivity of calcium-sensing receptor

*Target PTH*:
- Stage G3-G4: 35-70 pg/mL
- Stage G5: 150-300 pg/mL (higher acceptable on dialysis)

**Metabolic acidosis**:

*Common in CKD G4-G5*: Reduced acid excretion

*Consequences*: Bone disease, muscle wasting, progression of CKD

*Treatment*:
- **Sodium bicarbonate**: 650-1300 mg PO TID
- Target serum bicarbonate: 22-26 mEq/L
- Monitor: Electrolytes, BP (sodium load)

**Dyslipidemia**:

*Common in CKD*: High triglycerides, low HDL

*Treatment*:
- **Statins**: Reduce cardiovascular events in CKD G1-G4
- Not clearly beneficial in dialysis patients (initiate before dialysis)
- Target LDL: <100 mg/dL, or <70 if high cardiovascular risk

**Hyperkalemia**:

*Common in advanced CKD*, especially with RAAS inhibition

*Management*:
- Dietary potassium restriction (<2-3 g/day)
- Discontinue K-sparing diuretics
- Loop diuretics (promote K excretion)
- Potassium binders: Patiromer, sodium zirconium cyclosilicate
- Consider reducing/stopping ACE-I/ARB if refractory (but prefer to continue if possible)

**Volume overload**:
- Sodium restriction
- Loop diuretics (furosemide, torsemide, bumetanide)
- Dose: Higher doses needed as GFR declines
- If refractory: Ultrafiltration, dialysis

**Hypertension**:
- As described above
- Multiple agents usually required
- ACE-I/ARB, diuretics, calcium channel blockers, beta-blockers

**Cardiovascular disease**:
- Antiplatelet therapy (aspirin) if CAD
- Beta-blockers if HF or CAD
- Statins
- Optimize BP, glycemic control

### Preparation for Renal Replacement Therapy

**When to prepare**: eGFR <30 mL/min (Stage G4)

**Education**:
- Discuss options: Hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, kidney transplantation
- Timing of initiation

**Dialysis access**:
- **Hemodialysis**:
  - **AV fistula** (preferred): Created months before dialysis (maturation time)
  - **AV graft**: If fistula not feasible, shorter maturation
  - **Tunneled catheter**: Temporary, high infection risk
- **Peritoneal dialysis**: Catheter placement

**Transplant evaluation**:
- Refer early (eGFR <20 or dialysis imminent)
- Advantages: Best long-term outcomes, improved quality of life
- Living donor preferred
- Preemptive transplant (before dialysis) best

**Dietary counseling**:
- Low potassium, phosphate
- Protein restriction (0.6-0.8 g/kg/day) if not on dialysis

**Vaccination**:
- Hepatitis B (if not immune)
- Influenza (annual)
- Pneumococcal
- COVID-19

### Initiation of Dialysis

**Indications**:
- Symptoms of uremia (pericarditis, encephalopathy, refractory nausea/vomiting)
- Volume overload refractory to diuretics
- Refractory hyperkalemia or acidosis
- eGFR <10-15 mL/min (even if asymptomatic, controversial)

**Modalities**:

*Hemodialysis*:
- 3 times per week, 3-4 hours per session
- In-center or home hemodialysis
- Advantages: Efficient, supervised
- Disadvantages: Requires vascular access, hemodynamic changes, dietary restrictions

*Peritoneal dialysis*:
- Daily exchanges via peritoneal catheter
- Continuous ambulatory (CAPD) or automated (APD)
- Advantages: Home-based, steady state, dietary flexibility
- Disadvantages: Risk of peritonitis, requires manual dexterity, space for supplies

## Complications

**Cardiovascular disease**:
- Leading cause of death in CKD
- LVH, HF, CAD, arrhythmias, sudden cardiac death
- Vascular calcification, accelerated atherosclerosis

**Infections**:
- Impaired immune function
- Dialysis access infections

**Malnutrition**:
- Protein-energy wasting
- Sarcopenia

**Cognitive impairment**:
- Vascular dementia
- Uremic encephalopathy

**Fractures**:
- Renal osteodystrophy

**Peripheral neuropathy**:
- Uremic neuropathy

## Prognosis

**Progression to ESRD**:
- Risk varies by stage and albuminuria:
  - G1A1: Very low
  - G3aA2: Moderate
  - G4A3: Very high
- Diabetes, hypertension accelerate progression

**Mortality**:
- CKD increases cardiovascular mortality at all stages
- Dialysis patients: 5-year survival ~35%
- Transplant recipients: 5-year survival ~85% (best outcomes)

**Quality of life**:
- Significantly impaired in G4-G5
- Better with transplantation vs dialysis

## Key Points

- CKD is defined as kidney damage or eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m² for >3 months, staged by eGFR (G1-G5) and albuminuria (A1-A3)
- Diabetes and hypertension account for ~70% of CKD cases in the US
- BP control (<130/80 mmHg) and RAAS inhibition (ACE-I/ARB) slow progression, especially with albuminuria
- SGLT2 inhibitors (dapagliflozin, empagliflozin) reduce CKD progression and cardiovascular events regardless of diabetes status
- Anemia in CKD is treated with iron supplementation and ESAs (target Hgb 10-11.5 g/dL, avoid >11.5 g/dL)
- CKD-MBD requires dietary phosphate restriction, phosphate binders, vitamin D supplementation, and PTH monitoring
- Metabolic acidosis should be treated with sodium bicarbonate (target HCO3 22-26 mEq/L) to slow progression and reduce muscle wasting
- Dialysis preparation should begin at eGFR <30 mL/min with access creation and transplant evaluation
- Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in CKD; aggressive risk factor modification is essential
- Kidney transplantation offers the best survival and quality of life compared to dialysis
