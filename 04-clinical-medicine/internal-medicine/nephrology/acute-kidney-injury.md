# Acute Kidney Injury

## Overview

Acute kidney injury (AKI), previously termed acute renal failure, is a sudden decline in kidney function occurring over hours to days, characterized by an increase in serum creatinine, decrease in urine output, or both. AKI is common in hospitalized patients and associated with significant morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs.

### Definition

**KDIGO (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) criteria**: AKI is defined by any of the following:
- Increase in serum creatinine ≥0.3 mg/dL within 48 hours, OR
- Increase in serum creatinine to ≥1.5 times baseline within prior 7 days, OR
- Urine output <0.5 mL/kg/hr for 6 hours

**AKI staging** (KDIGO):
- **Stage 1**: Cr 1.5-1.9× baseline or ≥0.3 mg/dL increase; UO <0.5 mL/kg/hr for 6-12 hrs
- **Stage 2**: Cr 2.0-2.9× baseline; UO <0.5 mL/kg/hr for ≥12 hrs
- **Stage 3**: Cr ≥3.0× baseline or ≥4.0 mg/dL or initiation of RRT; UO <0.3 mL/kg/hr for ≥24 hrs or anuria ≥12 hrs

### Epidemiology

**Incidence**:
- Hospital-acquired AKI: 10-15% of all hospitalized patients
- ICU-acquired AKI: 40-60% of critically ill patients
- Community-acquired AKI: Less common, 1-2% of admissions
- Severe AKI requiring dialysis: 5-6% of ICU patients

**Outcomes**:
- In-hospital mortality: 10-20% overall, up to 50-60% in ICU with severe AKI
- Increased length of stay and healthcare costs
- Risk of progression to chronic kidney disease (30-70% depending on severity)
- Increased long-term mortality

**Risk factors**:
- Advanced age
- Chronic kidney disease
- Diabetes mellitus
- Heart failure
- Hypovolemia
- Sepsis
- Major surgery (cardiac, vascular, abdominal)
- Nephrotoxic medications
- Contrast exposure

## Pathophysiology

### Classification by Mechanism

**Prerenal AKI** (60-70% of cases):
- **Mechanism**: Reduced renal perfusion, intact tubular function
- Kidneys respond appropriately to hypoperfusion (avid sodium/water reabsorption)
- Reversible if perfusion restored quickly
- Prolonged prerenal state → acute tubular necrosis (intrinsic AKI)

**Intrinsic renal AKI** (25-40%):
- **Mechanism**: Direct injury to renal parenchyma
- Subtypes based on anatomic site:
  - Tubular: Acute tubular necrosis (ATN), acute interstitial nephritis (AIN)
  - Glomerular: Glomerulonephritis
  - Vascular: Renal artery thrombosis, atheroembolic disease, thrombotic microangiopathy
  - Interstitial: AIN

**Postrenal AKI** (5-10%):
- **Mechanism**: Obstruction to urine flow
- Requires bilateral obstruction (or unilateral in solitary kidney)
- Reversible if obstruction relieved promptly

### Prerenal AKI

**Causes**:

*Hypovolemia*:
- GI losses: Vomiting, diarrhea, GI bleeding
- Renal losses: Diuretics, osmotic diuresis (hyperglycemia), diabetes insipidus
- Skin losses: Burns, excessive sweating
- Third-spacing: Pancreatitis, cirrhosis, hypoalbuminemia

*Decreased cardiac output*:
- Heart failure (systolic or diastolic)
- Acute MI, cardiogenic shock
- Arrhythmias
- Massive PE
- Cardiac tamponade

*Systemic vasodilation*:
- Sepsis
- Anaphylaxis
- Antihypertensive medications (overtreatment)
- Cirrhosis (hepatorenal syndrome)

*Renal vasoconstriction*:
- NSAIDs: Inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, reduce afferent arteriolar dilation
- ACE inhibitors/ARBs: Reduce efferent arteriolar constriction (↓ GFR in bilateral RAS, stenosis in solitary kidney)
- Calcineurin inhibitors (cyclosporine, tacrolimus)
- Hepatorenal syndrome
- Hypercalcemia

**Pathophysiology**:
- Reduced renal blood flow → ↓ GFR
- Activation of RAAS and sympathetic nervous system
- Tubules remain functional, reabsorb sodium and water avidly
- Urine: Concentrated (high osmolality), low sodium, high urea

### Intrinsic Renal AKI

**Acute tubular necrosis (ATN)** - Most common intrinsic cause:

*Ischemic ATN*:
- Prolonged prerenal state
- Severe hypotension (shock, sepsis, cardiac arrest)
- Major surgery
- Pathology: Tubular epithelial cell death, loss of brush border, tubular obstruction by cellular debris

*Toxic ATN*:
- Exogenous toxins:
  - Aminoglycosides (gentamicin, tobramycin)
  - Vancomycin (high doses)
  - Amphotericin B
  - Contrast agents (iodinated radiocontrast)
  - Cisplatin, ifosfamide
  - Ethylene glycol, methanol
- Endogenous toxins:
  - Myoglobin (rhabdomyolysis)
  - Hemoglobin (massive hemolysis)
  - Light chains (multiple myeloma - cast nephropathy)
  - Uric acid (tumor lysis syndrome)
  - Calcium phosphate (tumor lysis)

**Acute interstitial nephritis (AIN)**:
- Allergic reaction to medications (most common cause)
- Drugs: Beta-lactam antibiotics (penicillins, cephalosporins), NSAIDs, PPIs, allopurinol, rifampin, sulfonamides
- Infections: Pyelonephritis, viral (CMV, EBV, HIV), Leptospira
- Autoimmune: SLE, Sjögren's syndrome, sarcoidosis, IgG4-related disease
- Pathology: Interstitial inflammation with lymphocytes, eosinophils

**Glomerulonephritis**:
- Rapidly progressive GN: ANCA-associated vasculitis, anti-GBM disease, lupus nephritis, post-infectious GN
- Presents with nephritic syndrome

**Vascular causes**:
- Renal artery thrombosis or embolism
- Renal vein thrombosis
- Atheroembolic disease (cholesterol emboli after vascular procedures)
- Thrombotic microangiopathy: HUS, TTP, malignant hypertension, scleroderma renal crisis
- Large vessel vasculitis

### Postrenal AKI

**Causes**:

*Ureteral obstruction* (bilateral required unless solitary kidney):
- Kidney stones
- Retroperitoneal fibrosis
- Malignancy: Bladder, prostate, cervical, colon cancer
- Iatrogenic: Surgical ligation

*Bladder neck obstruction*:
- Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH)
- Prostate cancer
- Bladder cancer
- Neurogenic bladder
- Anticholinergic medications

*Urethral obstruction*:
- Strictures
- Phimosis

**Pathophysiology**:
- Obstruction → ↑ intratubular pressure → ↓ GFR
- Initially reversible
- Prolonged obstruction → irreversible tubular damage, interstitial fibrosis

## Clinical Presentation

### Symptoms

**Often asymptomatic** in early stages (detected by routine labs)

**Symptoms when present**:
- Decreased urine output (oliguria <400 mL/day, anuria <50 mL/day)
- Nausea, vomiting, anorexia (uremia)
- Confusion, lethargy (uremic encephalopathy, electrolyte disturbances)
- Shortness of breath (volume overload, metabolic acidosis)
- Edema
- Flank pain (obstruction, renal infarction)
- Rash, fever, arthralgias (AIN)
- Gross hematuria (glomerulonephritis, stones)

### Physical Examination

**Volume status assessment**:
- Hypovolemia: Dry mucous membranes, decreased skin turgor, orthostatic hypotension, tachycardia
- Hypervolemia: Edema (peripheral, pulmonary, sacral), elevated JVP, rales, S3 gallop

**Signs of specific etiologies**:
- Abdominal masses, bladder distention (obstruction)
- Rash (AIN, vasculitis, atheroembolic disease)
- Livedo reticularis (atheroembolic disease)
- Myalgias, dark urine (rhabdomyolysis)
- Jaundice (hepatorenal syndrome)

## Diagnosis

### Initial Evaluation

**History**:
- Timeline of creatinine rise
- Recent illnesses, surgeries, procedures
- Medication review (NSAIDs, ACE-I/ARBs, diuretics, antibiotics, contrast)
- Volume status changes (vomiting, diarrhea, decreased PO intake)
- Symptoms of obstruction (hesitancy, weak stream, nocturia)

**Laboratory tests**:

*Serum*:
- Creatinine, BUN (BUN:Cr ratio helps classify)
- Electrolytes (hyperkalemia, acidosis common)
- Calcium, phosphate, uric acid (tumor lysis, rhabdomyolysis)
- CBC (anemia, thrombocytopenia in TMA, eosinophilia in AIN)
- CK (rhabdomyolysis)

*Urinalysis and microscopy* - Critical:
- Specific gravity
- Protein, blood
- **Microscopy**:
  - RBC casts: Glomerulonephritis
  - WBC casts: AIN, pyelonephritis
  - Muddy brown/granular casts: ATN
  - Hyaline casts: Prerenal
  - Eosinophiluria: AIN (not specific)
  - Crystals: Uric acid, calcium oxalate (ethylene glycol)

*Urine chemistry* (spot or random sample):
- Urine sodium (UNa)
- Urine osmolality
- Urine creatinine (calculate FENa, FEUrea)

**Diagnostic indices**:

*Fractional excretion of sodium (FENa)*:
FENa = (UNa × PCr) / (PNa × UCr) × 100

- FENa <1%: Prerenal (avid sodium reabsorption)
- FENa >2%: Intrinsic renal (ATN) or postrenal
- FENa 1-2%: Indeterminate

*Limitations*:
- Diuretics falsely elevate FENa
- Chronic kidney disease may have higher baseline FENa

*Fractional excretion of urea (FEUrea)*:
- More accurate if on diuretics
- FEUrea <35%: Prerenal
- FEUrea >50%: ATN

### Distinguishing Prerenal from Intrinsic (ATN)

| Parameter | Prerenal | ATN (Intrinsic) |
|-----------|----------|-----------------|
| BUN:Cr ratio | >20:1 | 10-15:1 |
| Urine sodium | <20 mEq/L | >40 mEq/L |
| FENa | <1% | >2% |
| Urine osmolality | >500 mOsm/kg | <350 mOsm/kg |
| Urine specific gravity | >1.020 | ~1.010 |
| Urine sediment | Hyaline casts | Muddy brown casts, epithelial cells |
| Response to fluids | Rapid improvement | No improvement |

### Imaging

**Renal ultrasound** - First-line imaging:
- Assess kidney size (small kidneys suggest CKD)
- Echogenicity (increased in CKD)
- Hydronephrosis (obstruction)
- Bladder distention
- Doppler: Renal blood flow (thrombosis, stenosis)

**CT scan** (non-contrast):
- Kidney stones
- Masses
- Retroperitoneal processes

**CT or MR angiography**:
- Renal artery stenosis or thrombosis

**Retrograde pyelography**:
- If suspected obstruction not seen on ultrasound

### Additional Testing Based on Suspected Etiology

**Rhabdomyolysis**:
- CK >1000 U/L (often >5000)
- Urine dipstick positive for blood, but no RBCs on microscopy (myoglobinuria)
- Hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, hypocalcemia

**Glomerulonephritis**:
- Serologies: ANA, anti-dsDNA, C3, C4, ANCA, anti-GBM, ASO, hepatitis B/C, HIV
- Cryoglobulins
- Serum and urine protein electrophoresis (if cast nephropathy suspected)
- Kidney biopsy

**Acute interstitial nephritis**:
- Eosinophils in urine (supportive, not diagnostic)
- Kidney biopsy (if diagnosis uncertain)

**Tumor lysis syndrome**:
- Hyperuricemia, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, hypocalcemia
- LDH elevated
- Usually post-chemotherapy

## Treatment

### General Principles

1. **Identify and treat underlying cause**
2. **Optimize hemodynamics and perfusion**
3. **Avoid further kidney injury** (stop nephrotoxins, adjust drug doses)
4. **Supportive care** (fluid/electrolyte management, nutrition)
5. **Renal replacement therapy** if indicated

### Prerenal AKI

**Fluid resuscitation**:
- IV crystalloids (normal saline or lactated Ringer's)
- Goal: Restore euvolemia, adequate perfusion
- Monitor: Urine output, vital signs, volume status
- Avoid overhydration (pulmonary edema)

**Optimize cardiac output**:
- Treat heart failure (diuretics if volume overloaded, inotropes if needed)
- Correct arrhythmias

**Discontinue offending medications**:
- NSAIDs
- Consider holding ACE-I/ARBs temporarily (restart when stable if CKD)
- Avoid diuretics until euvolemic

### Intrinsic Renal AKI

**ATN (ischemic or toxic)**:
- **Supportive care** (no specific therapy)
- Optimize renal perfusion
- Avoid further nephrotoxins
- Maintain euvolemia
- Recovery timeline: 1-3 weeks typically (regeneration of tubular epithelial cells)

**Rhabdomyolysis**:
- Aggressive IV fluid resuscitation (6-12 L/day initially)
- Goal urine output >200-300 mL/hr
- Alkalinize urine (IV bicarbonate) if pH <6.5 (controversial)
- Monitor and treat hyperkalemia, hypocalcemia (only if symptomatic), hyperphosphatemia
- Early dialysis if refractory hyperkalemia or severe AKI

**Contrast-induced AKI** (prevention):
- IV isotonic saline (1 mL/kg/hr for 12 hours before and after)
- N-acetylcysteine (evidence mixed)
- Minimize contrast volume
- Avoid NSAIDs, hold diuretics
- High-risk patients: Consider alternative imaging

**Acute interstitial nephritis**:
- **Discontinue offending drug** (essential)
- **Corticosteroids**: Prednisone 0.5-1 mg/kg/day for 4-6 weeks (if severe or no improvement)
- Most recover with drug cessation alone

**Glomerulonephritis**:
- Immunosuppression: Corticosteroids, cyclophosphamide, rituximab (depending on type)
- Plasmapheresis: Anti-GBM disease, severe ANCA vasculitis
- Refer to nephrology

**Tumor lysis syndrome** (prevention and treatment):
- Aggressive hydration
- **Allopurinol**: 300-600 mg/day (prevents uric acid formation)
- **Rasburicase**: Recombinant urate oxidase, converts uric acid to allantoin (more soluble)
- Avoid urine alkalinization if using rasburicase (reduces solubility of xanthine and hypoxanthine)
- Dialysis if refractory

**Thrombotic microangiopathy**:
- **TTP**: Urgent plasmapheresis, corticosteroids, rituximab
- **Atypical HUS**: Eculizumab (complement C5 inhibitor)

### Postrenal AKI

**Relieve obstruction**:
- **Foley catheter**: If bladder outlet obstruction
- **Nephrostomy tubes or ureteral stents**: If upper tract obstruction
- Urgent if bilateral or solitary kidney, infection, or severe AKI

**Post-obstructive diuresis**:
- After relief of bilateral obstruction, polyuria may occur
- Replace 50-75% of urine output with IV fluids (hypotonic saline)
- Monitor electrolytes (hypokalemia, hyponatremia)
- Usually resolves in 24-72 hours

### Supportive Care

**Fluid management**:
- Euvolemia goal
- Fluid restriction if anuric or oliguric with volume overload
- Daily weights

**Electrolyte management**:
- **Hyperkalemia**: Restrict dietary potassium, stop K-sparing diuretics, dialysis if severe
- **Metabolic acidosis**: Usually improves with treatment of AKI; give bicarbonate if pH <7.2 or serum HCO3 <12
- **Hyperphosphatemia**: Phosphate binders (calcium acetate, sevelamer)
- **Hypocalcemia**: Usually asymptomatic, treat only if severe or symptomatic

**Medication adjustments**:
- Dose adjust all renally cleared medications
- Avoid nephrotoxins

**Nutrition**:
- Adequate calories and protein (1-1.5 g/kg/day)
- Restrict potassium, phosphate
- May require enteral or parenteral nutrition

**Anemia**:
- Transfuse if symptomatic or Hgb <7 g/dL
- Avoid unnecessary transfusions (volume overload)

### Renal Replacement Therapy (RRT)

**Indications** (AEIOU):
- **A**cidosis: Severe metabolic acidosis (pH <7.1) refractory to medical management
- **E**lectrolytes: Hyperkalemia (>6.5 mEq/L) refractory to medical management
- **I**ngestions: Dialyzable toxins (methanol, ethylene glycol, salicylates, lithium)
- **O**verload: Volume overload with pulmonary edema refractory to diuretics
- **U**remia: Uremic complications (pericarditis, encephalopathy, bleeding)

**Modalities**:

*Intermittent hemodialysis (IHD)*:
- 3-4 hours, 3-7 times per week
- Rapid solute and fluid removal
- Risk of hemodynamic instability in critically ill

*Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT)*:
- 24-hour continuous therapy
- Hemodynamically better tolerated
- Preferred in ICU, hemodynamically unstable patients
- More expensive

*Peritoneal dialysis*:
- Rare in AKI (slower, less efficient)

**Complications**:
- Hypotension
- Bleeding (anticoagulation)
- Infections (catheter-related)
- Disequilibrium syndrome (rapid osmolar shifts)

## Complications

**Electrolyte abnormalities**:
- Hyperkalemia (life-threatening arrhythmias)
- Hyperphosphatemia
- Hypocalcemia
- Metabolic acidosis

**Volume overload**:
- Pulmonary edema
- Hypertension

**Uremia**:
- Pericarditis
- Encephalopathy
- Bleeding (platelet dysfunction)
- Nausea, vomiting

**Infections**:
- Increased susceptibility

**Progression to CKD**:
- 30-70% after severe AKI

## Prognosis

**Recovery**:
- Prerenal: Usually complete recovery if corrected promptly
- ATN: Most recover in 1-3 weeks; 10-20% require prolonged or permanent dialysis
- AIN: 50-70% complete recovery
- Postrenal: Depends on duration; prolonged obstruction → irreversible damage

**Mortality**:
- Stage 1 AKI: 5-10%
- Stage 2 AKI: 10-20%
- Stage 3 AKI: 20-50% (especially if dialysis required)
- Higher mortality in ICU patients, elderly, comorbidities

**Long-term outcomes**:
- Increased risk of CKD (even after "recovery")
- Increased cardiovascular events
- Increased all-cause mortality
- More severe and prolonged AKI → higher risk of CKD, ESRD

**Risk factors for progression to CKD**:
- Severity and duration of AKI
- Incomplete recovery
- Pre-existing CKD
- Repeated episodes of AKI
- Proteinuria

## Key Points

- AKI is defined by increased creatinine ≥0.3 mg/dL in 48 hours, or ≥1.5× baseline in 7 days, or oliguria <0.5 mL/kg/hr for 6 hours
- Prerenal AKI (most common) results from reduced renal perfusion and is characterized by FENa <1%, BUN:Cr >20:1, and concentrated urine
- ATN is the most common intrinsic cause, presenting with muddy brown casts, FENa >2%, and no response to fluids
- Postrenal AKI requires bilateral obstruction (or unilateral in solitary kidney) and is diagnosed by hydronephrosis on ultrasound
- Urinalysis with microscopy is critical: RBC casts indicate glomerulonephritis, WBC casts suggest AIN or pyelonephritis, muddy brown casts indicate ATN
- Treatment focuses on addressing the underlying cause, optimizing hemodynamics, avoiding nephrotoxins, and providing supportive care
- Indications for emergent dialysis include refractory hyperkalemia, severe acidosis, volume overload, and uremic complications (AEIOU)
- AIN is treated by stopping the offending drug; corticosteroids may accelerate recovery in severe cases
- Rhabdomyolysis requires aggressive IV hydration (goal urine output >200-300 mL/hr) and management of hyperkalemia
- Even after recovery, AKI increases the long-term risk of CKD, ESRD, cardiovascular events, and mortality
