# Nephrology

## Overview

Nephrology is the subspecialty of internal medicine focused on the diagnosis and treatment of kidney diseases. The kidneys play critical roles in maintaining homeostasis through regulation of fluid and electrolyte balance, blood pressure, acid-base balance, and elimination of metabolic waste products. Kidney disease affects millions worldwide and is a major cause of morbidity and mortality.

## Scope of Nephrology

### Major Topics

1. **Acute Kidney Injury**
   - Prerenal, intrinsic renal, and postrenal causes
   - Management and prevention
   - Renal replacement therapy

2. **Chronic Kidney Disease**
   - Staging and progression
   - Complications (anemia, bone disease, cardiovascular disease)
   - Dialysis and transplantation

3. **Glomerular Diseases**
   - Primary glomerulonephritis (minimal change, FSGS, membranous, IgA nephropathy)
   - Secondary glomerulonephritis (lupus nephritis, diabetic nephropathy, amyloidosis)
   - Nephritic and nephrotic syndromes

4. **Electrolyte and Acid-Base Disorders**
   - Sodium disorders (hyponatremia, hypernatremia)
   - Potassium disorders (hypokalemia, hyperkalemia)
   - Calcium and phosphate disorders
   - Acid-base disturbances (metabolic and respiratory)
   - Magnesium disorders

### Clinical Significance

- Chronic kidney disease affects ~15% of US adults (37 million people)
- End-stage renal disease affects >750,000 people in the US
- Leading causes: Diabetes (40%), hypertension (30%), glomerulonephritis (10%)
- CKD is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease
- Kidney disease is the 9th leading cause of death in the US

## Key Concepts

### Renal Physiology Fundamentals

**Glomerular filtration**:
- GFR: Normal 90-120 mL/min/1.73 m²
- Filtration of plasma at glomerulus
- Reabsorption and secretion along tubules

**Tubular function**:
- Proximal tubule: Reabsorbs 65-70% of filtered Na, water, glucose, amino acids, bicarbonate
- Loop of Henle: Concentrates/dilutes urine, reabsorbs 25% of filtered Na
- Distal tubule and collecting duct: Fine-tune electrolyte balance, acid-base regulation

**Endocrine functions**:
- Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system
- Erythropoietin production
- Vitamin D activation (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D)

### Assessment of Kidney Function

**Serum creatinine**:
- Marker of GFR, but affected by muscle mass, age, sex
- Less sensitive in early kidney disease

**Estimated GFR (eGFR)**:
- Calculated from creatinine using CKD-EPI equation
- Accounts for age, sex, race
- Most accurate assessment of kidney function

**Blood urea nitrogen (BUN)**:
- Reflects both GFR and protein metabolism
- BUN:Cr ratio helps distinguish prerenal from intrinsic AKI

**Urinalysis**:
- Dipstick: Protein, blood, glucose, pH, specific gravity
- Microscopy: RBCs, WBCs, casts, crystals
- Critical for diagnosing glomerular disease

**Urine protein quantification**:
- Spot urine protein-to-creatinine ratio (UPCR)
- 24-hour urine protein collection
- Microalbuminuria: Early marker of diabetic/hypertensive nephropathy

### Common Presentations

**Acute kidney injury**:
- Rapid decline in kidney function
- Elevated creatinine, oliguria/anuria
- Electrolyte abnormalities

**Chronic kidney disease**:
- Gradual loss of function over months to years
- Often asymptomatic until advanced stages
- Associated with anemia, bone disease, hypertension

**Nephrotic syndrome**:
- Heavy proteinuria (>3.5 g/day)
- Hypoalbuminemia, edema, hyperlipidemia

**Nephritic syndrome**:
- Hematuria, RBC casts, hypertension
- Variable proteinuria, edema

**Electrolyte emergencies**:
- Severe hyperkalemia: Cardiac arrhythmias
- Severe hyponatremia: Seizures, coma
- Severe hypercalcemia: Altered mental status

## Diagnostic Approach

### Laboratory Evaluation

**Basic metabolic panel**:
- Creatinine, BUN, electrolytes (Na, K, Cl, CO2)
- Calculate eGFR

**Complete blood count**:
- Anemia in CKD
- Eosinophilia in AIN

**Urinalysis with microscopy**:
- Essential first test

**Additional tests based on presentation**:
- Urine protein quantification
- Urine electrolytes (FENa, FEUN)
- Serologies (ANA, ANCA, complement, hepatitis, HIV)
- Serum and urine protein electrophoresis (if myeloma suspected)

### Imaging

**Renal ultrasound**:
- Kidney size and echogenicity
- Hydronephrosis (obstruction)
- Cysts, masses
- Doppler for vascular flow

**CT scan**:
- Kidney stones
- Masses
- Vascular anatomy (CT angiography)

**MRI/MRA**:
- Renal artery stenosis
- Detailed soft tissue characterization

### Kidney Biopsy

**Indications**:
- Unexplained AKI
- Nephrotic syndrome in adults
- Nephritic syndrome with unclear etiology
- CKD of unknown cause
- Suspected glomerulonephritis

**Interpretation**:
- Light microscopy
- Immunofluorescence
- Electron microscopy

## Management Principles

### Acute Kidney Injury

- Identify and treat underlying cause
- Optimize hemodynamics
- Avoid nephrotoxins
- Adjust medication doses
- Renal replacement therapy if indicated

### Chronic Kidney Disease

- Slow progression: BP control, RAAS inhibition, SGLT2 inhibitors
- Treat complications: Anemia (ESAs, iron), bone disease (phosphate binders, vitamin D), acidosis
- Cardiovascular risk reduction
- Prepare for RRT: Vascular access, transplant evaluation

### Dialysis

**Hemodialysis**:
- 3-4 times weekly, 3-4 hours per session
- Requires vascular access (fistula preferred)

**Peritoneal dialysis**:
- Daily exchanges via peritoneal catheter
- Continuous ambulatory or automated

**Indications for urgent dialysis (AEIOU)**:
- **A**cidosis (severe metabolic acidosis)
- **E**lectrolyte abnormalities (hyperkalemia)
- **I**ngestions (toxins)
- **O**verload (volume overload, pulmonary edema)
- **U**remia (pericarditis, encephalopathy, bleeding)

### Kidney Transplantation

- Best long-term outcome for ESRD
- Living or deceased donor
- Requires immunosuppression
- Complications: Rejection, infection, medication side effects
