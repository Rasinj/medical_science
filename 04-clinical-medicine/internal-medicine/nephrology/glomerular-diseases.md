# Glomerular Diseases

## Overview

Glomerular diseases encompass a diverse group of disorders affecting the glomerulus, the filtration unit of the kidney. These diseases can present with proteinuria, hematuria, reduced GFR, or combinations thereof. Glomerular diseases may be primary (limited to the kidney) or secondary (part of systemic disease) and are a significant cause of chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease.

### Clinical Syndromes

**Nephrotic syndrome**:
- Heavy proteinuria (>3.5 g/day or UPCR >3000-3500 mg/g)
- Hypoalbuminemia (<3.0 g/dL)
- Edema
- Hyperlipidemia
- Hypercoagulability

**Nephritic syndrome**:
- Hematuria (dysmorphic RBCs, RBC casts)
- Hypertension
- Edema
- Variable proteinuria (often sub-nephrotic)
- Decreased GFR/AKI

**Asymptomatic urinary abnormalities**:
- Isolated hematuria or proteinuria
- Detected incidentally

**Rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (RPGN)**:
- AKI with crescents on biopsy
- Nephritic syndrome
- Potential for irreversible kidney damage within days to weeks

### Epidemiology

**Incidence**:
- Primary glomerular disease: ~10-20 per million population per year
- Leading cause of ESRD in adults (after diabetes and hypertension)
- Age and demographics vary by disease type

**Distribution** (in adults undergoing biopsy):
- IgA nephropathy: Most common worldwide (30-40%)
- Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS): 20-25% (increasing in US)
- Membranous nephropathy: 15-20%
- Minimal change disease: 10-15%
- Membranoproliferative GN: 5-10%

## Pathophysiology

### Glomerular Structure

**Components**:
- Podocytes: Epithelial cells with foot processes, maintain filtration barrier
- Glomerular basement membrane (GBM)
- Endothelial cells
- Mesangium: Mesangial cells and matrix, provide structural support

**Filtration barrier**:
- Size-selective: Prevents filtration of large proteins
- Charge-selective: Negatively charged, repels albumin (anionic)

### Mechanisms of Injury

**Immune-mediated**:
- Antibody deposition: Anti-GBM, immune complexes (in situ or circulating)
- Complement activation
- T-cell mediated

**Non-immune**:
- Hemodynamic injury (hyperfiltration, hypertension)
- Toxins, drugs
- Genetic (podocyte mutations in FSGS)

**Consequences of injury**:
- Proteinuria: Loss of barrier integrity
- Hematuria: Glomerular capillary damage
- GFR decline: Loss of filtration surface, scarring
- Crescent formation: Severe injury with epithelial cell proliferation in Bowman's space (RPGN)

## Primary Glomerular Diseases

### Minimal Change Disease (MCD)

**Definition**: Nephrotic syndrome with normal glomeruli on light microscopy, foot process effacement on electron microscopy

**Epidemiology**:
- Most common cause of nephrotic syndrome in children (70-90%)
- Adults: 10-15% of nephrotic syndrome

**Clinical presentation**:
- Sudden onset nephrotic syndrome
- Selective proteinuria (mainly albumin)
- Normal GFR (typically)
- Edema

**Diagnosis**:
- Kidney biopsy:
  - Light microscopy: Normal appearing glomeruli
  - Immunofluorescence: Negative
  - Electron microscopy: Diffuse podocyte foot process effacement

**Treatment**:
- **Corticosteroids**:
  - Adults: Prednisone 1 mg/kg/day (max 80 mg) for 4-6 weeks, then taper
  - Children: Similar regimen
  - >90% respond (complete remission)
- **Relapse** (common):
  - Repeat steroids
  - Steroid-dependent or frequent relapsing: Cyclophosphamide, cyclosporine, mycophenolate mofetil, rituximab
- **Supportive**: Diuretics for edema, ACE-I/ARB

**Prognosis**:
- Excellent kidney function prognosis
- Low risk of progression to CKD
- Relapses common, especially in children

### Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis (FSGS)

**Definition**: Scarring (sclerosis) in some glomeruli (focal), affecting only part of glomerular tuft (segmental)

**Epidemiology**:
- Increasing incidence (most common primary cause of nephrotic syndrome in African Americans)
- Adults > children

**Classification**:
- **Primary (idiopathic) FSGS**: Podocyte injury, circulating permeability factors
- **Secondary FSGS**: Adaptive to reduced nephron mass (obesity, reflux nephropathy, sickle cell), viral (HIV), drugs (heroin, pamidronate), genetic (podocin, NPHS1, APOL1 variants)

**Clinical presentation**:
- Nephrotic syndrome (70%)
- Asymptomatic proteinuria (30%)
- Hypertension, reduced GFR (50%)
- Non-selective proteinuria

**Diagnosis**:
- Kidney biopsy:
  - Light microscopy: Segmental sclerosis in some glomeruli
  - Variants: Collapsing (worse prognosis), tip lesion (better prognosis), perihilar, cellular
  - Immunofluorescence: IgM and C3 in sclerotic segments
  - Electron microscopy: Foot process effacement

**Treatment**:
- **Idiopathic FSGS**:
  - **Corticosteroids**: Prednisone 1 mg/kg/day for 4-6 months (longer than MCD)
  - Response rate: 30-50% (slower than MCD, may take months)
  - **Second-line**: Calcineurin inhibitors (cyclosporine, tacrolimus), mycophenolate, rituximab
- **Secondary FSGS**:
  - Treat underlying cause
  - ACE-I/ARB for proteinuria reduction
- **Supportive**: BP control, ACE-I/ARB, lipid management

**Prognosis**:
- 50% progress to ESRD within 10 years (primary FSGS)
- Recurrence post-transplant: 30-50%

### Membranous Nephropathy

**Definition**: GBM thickening due to subepithelial immune complex deposition

**Epidemiology**:
- Most common cause of primary nephrotic syndrome in Caucasian adults
- Peak age 40-60 years

**Classification**:
- **Primary (idiopathic) MN**: 75%
  - Anti-phospholipase A2 receptor (PLA2R) antibodies in 70-80%

**Diagnosis**:
- Kidney biopsy:
  - Light microscopy: Thickened GBM, "spike and dome" appearance (silver stain)
  - Immunofluorescence: Granular IgG and C3 along capillary walls
  - Electron microscopy: Subepithelial electron-dense deposits
- **Serology**: Anti-PLA2R antibodies (diagnostic, correlates with disease activity)

**Treatment**:
- **Observation**: If low-risk (normal GFR, proteinuria <4 g/day)
  - 30-40% spontaneous remission
- **Immunosuppression**: If high-risk (proteinuria >4 g/day, declining GFR)
  - **Cyclical therapy**: Alternating corticosteroids and alkylating agents (cyclophosphamide or chlorambucil) for 6 months
  - **Calcineurin inhibitors**: Cyclosporine or tacrolimus
  - **Rituximab**: Increasingly used, depletes B cells
- **Supportive**: ACE-I/ARB, anticoagulation if severe hypoalbuminemia or thrombosis

**Prognosis**:
- Spontaneous remission: 30-40% within 2 years
- 30-40% progress to ESRD over 10-20 years
- Recurrence post-transplant: 30-40%

### IgA Nephropathy

**Definition**: Glomerulonephritis characterized by dominant IgA deposition in mesangium

**Epidemiology**:
- Most common primary glomerulonephritis worldwide
- Highest incidence in Asia (40-50% of GN)
- Young adults (20-40 years), males > females

**Clinical presentation**:

- **Persistent microscopic hematuria** with variable proteinuria (40%)
- **Nephrotic syndrome** (5-10%)
- **RPGN** (rare)
- Slowly progressive CKD

**Diagnosis**:
- Kidney biopsy:

  - BP control: <130/80 mmHg
  - Omega-3 fatty acids
- **Immunosuppression** (if high-risk: proteinuria >1 g/day despite RAAS inhibition):
  - **Corticosteroids**: Methylprednisolone pulses or oral prednisone
  - Evidence mixed, risk of adverse effects

- **Tonsillectomy**: Practiced in Asia, limited evidence

**Prognosis**:
- Variable: 30-40% progress to ESRD within 20 years
- Worse prognosis: Persistent proteinuria >1 g/day, hypertension, reduced GFR, crescents on biopsy
- Recurrence post-transplant: 30-50%

### Membranoproliferative Glomerulonephritis (MPGN)

**Definition**: Glomerulonephritis with mesangial proliferation and GBM thickening/duplication

**Classification**:
- **Immune complex-mediated MPGN**: Secondary to infections (HCV, HBV), autoimmune (SLE, cryoglobulinemia), monoclonal gammopathy

  - Electron microscopy: Subendothelial deposits, mesangial interposition

**Treatment**:
- Treat underlying cause (e.g., antivirals for HCV)
- Complement inhibition (eculizumab) for C3 glomerulopathy
- Immunosuppression case-dependent

**Prognosis**:
- 50% progress to ESRD within 10 years

## Secondary Glomerular Diseases

### Diabetic Nephropathy

**Most common cause of ESRD in developed countries**

**Pathogenesis**:
- Hyperglycemia → non-enzymatic glycation, oxidative stress, hemodynamic changes
- Mesangial matrix expansion, GBM thickening
- Glomerulosclerosis (Kimmelstiel-Wilson nodules)

**Clinical presentation**:
- Albuminuria → progressive proteinuria (can be nephrotic-range)
- Hypertension
- Gradual GFR decline
- Usually coexists with diabetic retinopathy

**Diagnosis**:
- Clinical diagnosis in diabetic patients with albuminuria and retinopathy
- Biopsy if atypical features (no retinopathy, rapid progression, nephritic features)

**Treatment**:
- **Glycemic control**: HbA1c <7%
- **BP control**: <130/80 mmHg
- **RAAS inhibition**: ACE-I or ARB (first-line, reduce albuminuria, slow progression)
- **SGLT2 inhibitors**: Dapagliflozin, empagliflozin (reduce albuminuria, slow progression, cardiovascular benefits)
- **GLP-1 receptor agonists**: Reduce albuminuria
- **Finerenone**: Nonsteroidal MRA, reduces albuminuria and CKD progression

**Prognosis**:
- Progressive to ESRD in many patients
- Cardiovascular disease leading cause of death

### Lupus Nephritis

**50-60% of SLE patients develop kidney involvement**

**Classification (ISN/RPS)**:
- Class I: Minimal mesangial
- Class II: Mesangial proliferative
- Class III: Focal proliferative (<50% glomeruli)
- Class IV: Diffuse proliferative (>50% glomeruli) - most severe
- Class V: Membranous
- Class VI: Advanced sclerosis

**Clinical presentation**:
- Varies by class
- Hematuria, proteinuria (can be nephrotic), AKI
- Active urine sediment (RBC/WBC casts)
- Low complement (C3, C4), positive anti-dsDNA

**Diagnosis**:
- **Kidney biopsy**: Essential for classification and treatment decisions

**Treatment** (Class III/IV):
- **Induction**:
  - **Corticosteroids**: High-dose prednisone + taper
  - **Mycophenolate mofetil** (preferred) or **cyclophosphamide**
- **Maintenance**:
  - Mycophenolate or azathioprine for 2-3 years
- **Adjunctive**: Hydroxychloroquine, ACE-I/ARB
- **Class V**: Similar to membranous nephropathy

**Prognosis**:
- Improved with modern therapy
- 10-20% progress to ESRD within 10 years

### Amyloidosis

**AL (light chain) amyloidosis** most commonly affects kidney

**Clinical presentation**:
- Nephrotic syndrome
- Large kidneys on ultrasound
- Monoclonal protein (SPEP/UPEP)

**Diagnosis**:
- Biopsy: Congo red stain, apple-green birefringence
- Typing: Immunofluorescence, mass spectrometry

**Treatment**:
- Chemotherapy directed at plasma cell clone (AL)
- Supportive care

**Prognosis**:
- Poor without treatment
- ESRD common

## Rapidly Progressive Glomerulonephritis (RPGN)

### Definition

AKI with crescent formation in >50% of glomeruli on biopsy, potential for irreversible kidney damage within days to weeks if untreated

### Classification by Immunofluorescence

**Type I (anti-GBM disease)**:
- Linear IgG along GBM
- Goodpasture syndrome if pulmonary hemorrhage

**Type II (immune complex-mediated)**:
- Granular deposits
- Causes: Post-infectious GN, lupus, IgA nephropathy, cryoglobulinemia

**Type III (pauci-immune)**:
- Minimal immunoglobulin deposition
- ANCA-associated vasculitis: GPA, MPA, EGPA
- Most common cause of RPGN in adults

### Clinical Presentation

- AKI (creatinine rising over days-weeks)
- Nephritic syndrome
- Oliguria/anuria
- Pulmonary hemorrhage (anti-GBM, ANCA vasculitis)
- Systemic vasculitis features (ANCA)

### Diagnosis

- **Urgent kidney biopsy**
- **Serologies**: ANCA (MPO, PR3), anti-GBM, ANA, complement, cryoglobulins, ASLO

### Treatment

**Urgent immunosuppression** required:
- **Corticosteroids**: IV methylprednisolone pulses, then oral prednisone
- **Cyclophosphamide** or **rituximab**: Induction therapy
- **Plasmapheresis**: Anti-GBM disease, severe ANCA vasculitis
- **Dialysis**: If oliguric/anuric, severe AKI

### Prognosis

- Early treatment critical (before irreversible scarring)
- Dialysis-dependent at presentation: Poor renal recovery
- Relapse common in ANCA vasculitis

## Key Points

- Nephrotic syndrome is characterized by heavy proteinuria (>3.5 g/day), hypoalbuminemia, edema, and hyperlipidemia; nephritic syndrome presents with hematuria, RBC casts, hypertension, and variable proteinuria
- Minimal change disease is the most common cause of nephrotic syndrome in children, responds well to corticosteroids (>90%), but relapses are common
- FSGS is increasing in incidence and accounts for 20-25% of primary nephrotic syndrome; only 30-50% respond to steroids, and 50% progress to ESRD
- Membranous nephropathy is associated with anti-PLA2R antibodies in 70-80% of primary cases; treatment depends on risk stratification (proteinuria, GFR)
- IgA nephropathy is the most common primary glomerulonephritis worldwide, presenting with episodic gross hematuria concurrent with URI; treatment focuses on ACE-I/ARB and BP control
- Lupus nephritis Class III/IV requires aggressive immunosuppression with corticosteroids plus mycophenolate (preferred) or cyclophosphamide for induction
- Diabetic nephropathy is managed with glycemic control, ACE-I/ARB, SGLT2 inhibitors, and BP control (<130/80 mmHg) to slow progression
- RPGN is a medical emergency requiring urgent biopsy and immunosuppression; ANCA-associated vasculitis is the most common cause in adults
- Kidney biopsy interpretation includes light microscopy, immunofluorescence (IgG, IgA, IgM, C3, C1q), and electron microscopy for definitive diagnosis
- Anti-GBM disease and severe ANCA vasculitis require plasmapheresis in addition to immunosuppression
