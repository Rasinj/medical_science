# Adrenal Disorders

## Overview

The adrenal glands are paired endocrine organs located superior to each kidney. Each gland consists of two functionally distinct regions: the cortex (outer layer) and the medulla (inner core). Adrenal disorders result from hormone excess or deficiency and can significantly impact metabolism, blood pressure regulation, stress response, and electrolyte balance.

### Adrenal Anatomy and Physiology

**Adrenal cortex** (produces steroid hormones):
- **Zona glomerulosa** (outer):
  - Produces mineralocorticoids (aldosterone)
  - Regulated by renin-angiotensin system and potassium
  - Controls sodium reabsorption and potassium excretion

- **Zona fasciculata** (middle):
  - Produces glucocorticoids (cortisol)
  - Regulated by ACTH from pituitary
  - Controls glucose metabolism, immune function, stress response

- **Zona reticularis** (inner):
  - Produces androgens (DHEA, androstenedione)
  - Regulated by ACTH
  - Precursors for sex hormones

**Adrenal medulla**:
- Produces catecholamines (epinephrine, norepinephrine)
- Regulated by sympathetic nervous system
- Controls fight-or-flight response

**Cortisol physiology**:
- Circadian rhythm (peak 6-8 AM, nadir midnight)
- Increases blood glucose (gluconeogenesis, insulin resistance)
- Anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects
- Maintains vascular tone and blood pressure
- Stress hormone (surgery, illness, trauma)

### Epidemiology

- **Cushing's syndrome**: 2-3 per million annually (endogenous), more common with exogenous steroids
- **Addison's disease**: 4-6 per 100,000
- **Pheochromocytoma**: 2-8 per million, found in 0.1-0.6% of hypertensive patients
- **Primary hyperaldosteronism**: 5-10% of hypertensive patients, up to 20% with resistant hypertension

## Cushing's Syndrome

### Definition and Etiology

**Cushing's syndrome**: Clinical state resulting from prolonged exposure to excess glucocorticoids

**ACTH-dependent** (80%):
- **Cushing's disease** (70% of endogenous cases):
  - Pituitary adenoma secreting ACTH
  - Usually microadenoma (<10 mm)
  - More common in women (3:1)
  - Peak age 20-40 years

- **Ectopic ACTH syndrome** (10%):
  - Non-pituitary tumor secreting ACTH
  - Small cell lung cancer (50%)
  - Bronchial carcinoid (25%)
  - Thymic carcinoid, pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors
  - Often presents with severe, rapid-onset symptoms

**ACTH-independent** (20%):
- **Adrenal adenoma**: Benign cortisol-secreting tumor
- **Adrenal carcinoma**: Malignant, aggressive
- **Bilateral adrenal hyperplasia**: Rare, genetic causes (PPNAD, BMAH)

**Exogenous (most common overall)**:
- Chronic glucocorticoid therapy
- Oral, inhaled, topical, or injected steroids
- Risk increases with dose and duration

### Pathophysiology

**Excess cortisol effects**:
- **Metabolic**: Hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, central obesity
- **Catabolic**: Muscle wasting, skin thinning, easy bruising, poor wound healing
- **Bone**: Decreased bone formation, increased resorption → osteoporosis
- **Cardiovascular**: Hypertension, increased cardiovascular risk
- **Immune**: Immunosuppression, increased infection risk
- **Psychiatric**: Depression, anxiety, psychosis, cognitive impairment
- **Reproductive**: Hypogonadism, menstrual irregularities

### Clinical Presentation

**Classic features**:
- **Central obesity**: Moon facies, buffalo hump, truncal obesity with thin extremities
- **Skin changes**:
  - Purple striae (>1 cm wide, abdomen, thighs, breasts, axillae)
  - Thin, fragile skin
  - Easy bruising
  - Poor wound healing
  - Acne and facial plethora
  - Hyperpigmentation (if ACTH-dependent)

- **Muscle weakness**: Proximal myopathy (difficulty rising from chair, climbing stairs)
- **Bone disease**: Osteoporosis, pathologic fractures
- **Metabolic**: Glucose intolerance or diabetes (75%), dyslipidemia
- **Hypertension** (80%)
- **Psychiatric**: Depression, anxiety, irritability, insomnia, psychosis
- **Menstrual irregularities** or hirsutism (women)
- **Decreased libido** and erectile dysfunction (men)

**Physical examination**:
- Moon facies with facial plethora
- Supraclavicular and dorsocervical fat pads
- Central adiposity with thin extremities
- Wide purple striae
- Proximal muscle wasting and weakness
- Skin thinning and bruising
- Hirsutism (women)

### Diagnosis

**Screening** (perform in high-risk patients):
- Young patient with hypertension and hypokalemia
- Diabetes with poor control and typical features
- Osteoporosis (especially in young patients)
- Adrenal incidentaloma
- Multiple features suggestive of Cushing's syndrome

**Initial testing** (demonstrate hypercortisolism):
1. **24-hour urinary free cortisol (UFC)**:
   - Elevated (>3x upper limit of normal highly specific)
   - Collect two samples
   - False positives: Pseudo-Cushing's (obesity, depression, alcoholism), pregnancy

2. **Late-night salivary cortisol** (2 samples):
   - Loss of circadian rhythm
   - Elevated (>2x upper limit of normal)
   - Convenient, non-invasive
   - Avoid contamination (blood, food)

3. **1-mg overnight dexamethasone suppression test**:
   - Give 1 mg dexamethasone at 11 PM
   - Measure cortisol at 8 AM next morning
   - Normal: Cortisol <1.8 mcg/dL
   - Cushing's: Failed suppression
   - False positives: Medications affecting dexamethasone metabolism (phenytoin, rifampin), oral estrogens

**Confirming diagnosis**:
- Perform 2 different first-line tests
- If discordant, consider 48-hour low-dose dexamethasone suppression test

**Differential diagnosis** (determine etiology):
1. **Plasma ACTH**:
   - ACTH-dependent: ACTH >20 pg/mL (pituitary or ectopic)
   - ACTH-independent: ACTH <5 pg/mL (adrenal)

2. **If ACTH-dependent, distinguish pituitary from ectopic**:
   - **High-dose dexamethasone suppression test**:
     - 8 mg dexamethasone at 11 PM or 2 mg every 6 hours for 48 hours
     - Pituitary: >50% suppression of cortisol or UFC
     - Ectopic: No suppression
     - Limitations: Not always reliable

   - **CRH stimulation test**:
     - Give CRH 100 mcg IV
     - Pituitary: ACTH and cortisol rise >20% and >50% respectively
     - Ectopic: Little or no response

   - **Bilateral inferior petrosal sinus sampling (IPSS)**:
     - Gold standard for differentiating pituitary from ectopic ACTH
     - Central-to-peripheral ACTH ratio >2 baseline or >3 after CRH → pituitary
     - Invasive, requires expertise

**Imaging**:
- **Pituitary MRI**: Microadenoma visible in ~50% of Cushing's disease
- **Adrenal CT/MRI**: Identify adenoma or carcinoma
- **Chest/abdomen/pelvis CT**: Search for ectopic ACTH source

### Treatment

**Surgical treatment** (first-line for most cases):
- **Cushing's disease**:
  - Transsphenoidal pituitary surgery (TSS)
  - Cure rate: 70-90% for microadenomas
  - Repeat surgery or radiation if persistent

- **Adrenal adenoma/carcinoma**:
  - Laparoscopic or open adrenalectomy
  - Cure rate: ~95% for adenomas

- **Ectopic ACTH**:
  - Surgical resection of tumor if localized
  - Often advanced disease, may require bilateral adrenalectomy

**Medical therapy** (adjunct or if surgery not possible):
- **Steroidogenesis inhibitors**:
  - Ketoconazole: 200-400 mg 2-3 times daily (hepatotoxic)
  - Metyrapone: 250-500 mg 3-4 times daily
  - Osilodrostat: Newer, more effective

- **Adrenolytic agent**:
  - Mitotane: For adrenal carcinoma, adjuvant therapy

- **Pituitary-directed**:
  - Pasireotide: Somatostatin analog, approved for Cushing's disease
  - Cabergoline: Dopamine agonist (off-label)

- **Glucocorticoid receptor antagonist**:
  - Mifepristone: Blocks cortisol action, for persistent/recurrent disease
  - Cannot monitor with cortisol levels

**Radiation therapy**:
- Pituitary radiation for persistent Cushing's disease after surgery
- Slow onset of effect (months to years)
- Risk of hypopituitarism

**Perioperative management**:
- Stress-dose steroids during and after surgery
- Gradual taper as HPA axis recovers
- Monitor for adrenal insufficiency

**Complications of treatment**:
- Adrenal insufficiency (requires replacement)
- Hypopituitarism after TSS or radiation
- Diabetes insipidus (transient or permanent)
- CSF leak, meningitis (TSS)

## Adrenal Insufficiency (Addison's Disease)

### Definition and Etiology

**Primary adrenal insufficiency** (Addison's disease):
- Destruction of adrenal cortex
- Deficiency of cortisol, aldosterone, and adrenal androgens
- Elevated ACTH (loss of negative feedback)

**Causes**:
- **Autoimmune adrenalitis** (80% in developed countries):
  - Anti-21-hydroxylase antibodies
  - Isolated or part of polyglandular autoimmune syndrome (APS-1 or APS-2)
  - Associated with other autoimmune diseases (thyroid, diabetes, vitiligo)

- **Infectious**:
  - Tuberculosis (most common worldwide)
  - Histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis
  - HIV, CMV

- **Hemorrhage**:
  - Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome (meningococcemia)
  - Anticoagulation
  - Antiphospholipid syndrome

- **Infiltrative**: Metastatic cancer (lung, breast, melanoma), lymphoma, sarcoidosis, amyloidosis
- **Medications**: Ketoconazole, etomidate, mitotane
- **Genetic**: Congenital adrenal hyperplasia, adrenoleukodystrophy

**Secondary adrenal insufficiency**:
- ACTH deficiency (pituitary or hypothalamic disease)
- Aldosterone production intact (mineralocorticoid deficiency only with primary AI)
- Most common cause: Chronic exogenous glucocorticoid therapy with HPA axis suppression

### Pathophysiology

**Cortisol deficiency**:
- Hypoglycemia (impaired gluconeogenesis)
- Hypotension (decreased vascular tone)
- Inability to respond to stress
- Fatigue, weakness

**Aldosterone deficiency** (primary AI only):
- Hyponatremia (sodium loss)
- Hyperkalemia (potassium retention)
- Hypovolemia and hypotension
- Metabolic acidosis

**Elevated ACTH** (primary AI):
- Hyperpigmentation (ACTH and MSH share melanocortin receptors)

### Clinical Presentation

**Chronic primary adrenal insufficiency**:
- **Symptoms** (insidious onset):
  - Fatigue and weakness (100%)
  - Weight loss (100%)
  - Anorexia, nausea (90%)
  - Abdominal pain
  - Salt craving (80%)
  - Postural dizziness
  - Myalgias, arthralgias
  - Depression

- **Physical examination**:
  - Hyperpigmentation (94%): Skin creases, extensor surfaces, buccal mucosa, scars, nipples
  - Hypotension (90%), orthostatic hypotension
  - Vitiligo (10-20%)
  - Loss of axillary and pubic hair (women, androgen deficiency)

**Secondary adrenal insufficiency**:
- Similar to primary but:
  - No hyperpigmentation (low ACTH)
  - No hyperkalemia (intact aldosterone)
  - May have features of pituitary disease (headache, visual changes, other hormone deficiencies)

**Acute adrenal crisis**:
- Life-threatening medical emergency
- Precipitants: Stress (infection, surgery, trauma), abrupt steroid withdrawal, bilateral adrenal hemorrhage

- **Symptoms**:
  - Severe weakness, confusion, lethargy
  - Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain
  - Fever
  - Altered mental status, coma

- **Physical examination**:
  - Hypotension, shock
  - Fever or hypothermia
  - Abdominal tenderness (may mimic acute abdomen)

### Diagnosis

**Laboratory findings** (chronic AI):
- Hyponatremia (85-90%)
- Hyperkalemia (60-65%, primary AI only)
- Mild metabolic acidosis
- Hypoglycemia (especially in children)
- Anemia, lymphocytosis, eosinophilia
- Elevated TSH (may normalize after treatment)
- Hypercalcemia (rare)

**Screening**:
- **8 AM cortisol**:
  - <3 mcg/dL: Diagnostic of AI
  - >18-20 mcg/dL: Rules out AI
  - 3-18 mcg/dL: Perform ACTH stimulation test

**Confirmatory testing**:
- **ACTH stimulation test** (cosyntropin test):
  - Measure baseline cortisol and ACTH
  - Give cosyntropin 250 mcg IV or IM
  - Measure cortisol at 30 and 60 minutes
  - Normal: Peak cortisol >18-20 mcg/dL
  - AI: Impaired response
  - Note: May be normal in early secondary AI (adrenals not yet atrophied)

**Determining etiology**:
- **Plasma ACTH**:
  - Primary AI: ACTH >2x upper limit of normal
  - Secondary AI: ACTH low or inappropriately normal

- **If primary AI**:
  - 21-hydroxylase antibodies (autoimmune)
  - Adrenal CT: Bilateral enlargement (infection, infiltration, hemorrhage) or atrophy (autoimmune)
  - Consider TB testing, HIV testing

- **If secondary AI**:
  - Pituitary MRI
  - Assess other pituitary hormones
  - Review medication history (steroids)

### Treatment

**Chronic replacement therapy**:
1. **Glucocorticoid replacement**:
   - Hydrocortisone 15-25 mg daily in divided doses (10-15 mg AM, 5-10 mg early afternoon)
   - Mimic physiologic secretion (2/3 morning, 1/3 afternoon)
   - Alternatives: Prednisone 5 mg daily, dexamethasone 0.5 mg daily (longer-acting, less physiologic)
   - Titrate based on clinical symptoms, not cortisol levels

2. **Mineralocorticoid replacement** (primary AI only):
   - Fludrocortisone 0.05-0.2 mg daily
   - Monitor blood pressure, serum potassium, plasma renin activity
   - Goal: Normal BP without orthostasis, normal K, renin in upper normal range

3. **DHEA replacement** (optional, women only):
   - 25-50 mg daily
   - May improve well-being and libido
   - Evidence limited

**Stress dosing**:
- **Minor illness** (fever, URI): Double or triple usual dose for 2-3 days
- **Moderate stress** (GI illness, dental procedures): Hydrocortisone 50 mg every 6-8 hours
- **Severe stress/surgery**: Hydrocortisone 100 mg IV every 6-8 hours, taper over 1-3 days
- Patient education: Wear medical alert bracelet, carry injectable hydrocortisone

**Acute adrenal crisis management**:
1. **Immediate treatment** (don't delay for testing):
   - IV hydrocortisone 100 mg bolus, then 50-100 mg every 6-8 hours
   - Aggressive IV fluid resuscitation: 0.9% saline 1-2 L first hour
   - Dextrose if hypoglycemic

2. **Supportive care**:
   - Correct electrolyte abnormalities
   - Treat precipitating cause (infection, etc.)
   - Hemodynamic monitoring

3. **Diagnostic testing** (before steroids if possible):
   - Cortisol and ACTH levels
   - If unstable, give steroids first and test later

4. **Transition to chronic therapy**:
   - Taper IV hydrocortisone over 1-3 days
   - Resume oral replacement when stable
   - Add fludrocortisone (primary AI)

## Pheochromocytoma and Paraganglioma

### Definition and Etiology

**Pheochromocytoma**: Catecholamine-secreting tumor arising from adrenal medulla chromaffin cells

**Paraganglioma**: Extra-adrenal catecholamine-secreting tumor from sympathetic or parasympathetic paraganglia

**Rule of 10s** (historical, less accurate now):
- 10% bilateral
- 10% extra-adrenal
- 10% malignant
- 10% familial
- 10% in children

**Updated epidemiology**:
- 30-40% hereditary (genetic testing recommended for all)
- 10-15% malignant (higher for extra-adrenal)

**Hereditary syndromes**:
- **Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2)**: RET mutation, associated with medullary thyroid cancer, hyperparathyroidism
- **Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL)**: VHL mutation, associated with hemangioblastomas, renal cell carcinoma
- **Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1)**: NF1 mutation
- **Succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) mutations**: SDHB (higher malignancy risk), SDHD, SDHC, SDHA

### Pathophysiology

**Catecholamine effects**:
- Norepinephrine and epinephrine secretion
- Alpha-adrenergic: Vasoconstriction, hypertension
- Beta-adrenergic: Tachycardia, increased cardiac output
- Metabolic: Hyperglycemia, lipolysis
- Episodic release → paroxysmal symptoms

### Clinical Presentation

**Classic triad** (50%):
- Headaches
- Sweating
- Palpitations

**Symptoms** (often paroxysmal):
- Severe hypertension (episodic or sustained)
- Headaches (80%)
- Excessive sweating (70%)
- Palpitations (60%)
- Anxiety, sense of impending doom
- Tremor
- Chest or abdominal pain
- Nausea
- Weight loss
- Heat intolerance

**Physical examination**:
- Hypertension (90%): Sustained or paroxysmal
- Orthostatic hypotension (paradoxical, volume contraction)
- Tachycardia
- Pallor during attack
- Fever
- Café-au-lait spots (NF1)

**Complications**:
- Hypertensive crisis
- Myocardial infarction
- Stroke
- Cardiomyopathy (catecholamine-induced)
- Arrhythmias

### Diagnosis

**When to suspect**:
- Paroxysmal symptoms (triad)
- Resistant hypertension
- Hypertension in young patient
- Incidental adrenal mass
- Family history or genetic syndrome
- Severe hypertensive response to anesthesia or surgery

**Biochemical testing** (first-line):
- **Plasma free metanephrines and normetanephrines**:
  - Highest sensitivity (96-99%)
  - Preferred screening test
  - Fasting not required
  - Avoid certain medications (tricyclics, stimulants)

- **24-hour urine metanephrines and catecholamines**:
  - Alternative to plasma metanephrines
  - Requires complete collection

**Interpretation**:
- >4x upper limit of normal: Highly specific for pheochromocytoma
- Borderline elevation: Repeat testing, clonidine suppression test

**False positives**:
- Medications: Tricyclic antidepressants, decongestants, stimulants, MAO inhibitors
- Physiologic stress
- Obstructive sleep apnea
- Renal failure

**Imaging** (after biochemical confirmation):
- **Adrenal CT or MRI**:
  - Locate tumor
  - MRI: T2 hyperintense ("light bulb sign")
  - Caution: Avoid IV contrast before alpha blockade (can precipitate crisis)

- **Functional imaging** (if CT/MRI negative or metastatic disease):
  - 123I-MIBG scan: Specific for chromaffin tumors
  - 68Ga-DOTATATE PET: High sensitivity for paragangliomas
  - 18F-FDG PET: Metastatic or SDH-mutated tumors

**Genetic testing**:
- Recommended for all patients with pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma
- Test for: RET, VHL, NF1, SDHx genes, others based on clinical features

### Treatment

**Preoperative preparation**:
1. **Alpha-adrenergic blockade** (start 10-14 days before surgery):
   - Phenoxybenzamine 10 mg twice daily, increase every 2-3 days to 20-100 mg twice daily
   - Or doxazosin 2-32 mg daily (selective, shorter-acting)
   - Goals: BP <130/80, orthostatic hypotension (mild)

2. **Beta-adrenergic blockade** (add AFTER alpha blockade):
   - Prevents reflex tachycardia
   - Propranolol 10-40 mg 3-4 times daily
   - Atenolol 25-100 mg daily
   - NEVER give before alpha blockade (unopposed alpha → hypertensive crisis)

3. **Volume expansion**:
   - Liberal salt and fluid intake
   - Reverses chronic volume contraction

**Surgical resection**:
- **Laparoscopic adrenalectomy**: Preferred for benign, unilateral tumors <6 cm
- **Open adrenalectomy**: Large tumors, suspected malignancy, extra-adrenal
- Intraoperative: Close hemodynamic monitoring, arterial line, may need nitroprusside for BP control
- Postoperative: Monitor for hypoglycemia and hypotension

**Malignant pheochromocytoma**:
- Defined by presence of metastases (bone, liver, lymph nodes, lung)
- Cannot be determined by histology alone
- Treatment:
  - Surgical debulking if feasible
  - 131I-MIBG therapy
  - Chemotherapy: CVD regimen (cyclophosphamide, vincristine, dacarbazine)
  - Targeted therapy: Sunitinib, everolimus (investigational)
- 5-year survival: 40-60%

**Medical management** (if surgery not possible):
- Alpha and beta blockade for symptom control
- Metyrosine: Inhibits catecholamine synthesis

## Primary Hyperaldosteronism

### Definition and Etiology

**Primary hyperaldosteronism (PA)**: Autonomous aldosterone production independent of renin-angiotensin system

**Causes**:
- **Bilateral adrenal hyperplasia (BAH)** (60%): Idiopathic hyperplasia of both adrenals
- **Aldosterone-producing adenoma (APA)** (35%): Unilateral adrenal adenoma (Conn's syndrome)
- **Unilateral adrenal hyperplasia** (2%)
- **Aldosterone-producing carcinoma** (<1%): Rare, malignant
- **Familial hyperaldosteronism** (1-3%):
  - Type I (glucocorticoid-remediable): Chimeric gene, suppressible with dexamethasone
  - Type II: Familial, various causes

### Pathophysiology

**Aldosterone effects**:
- Increased sodium reabsorption in distal tubule
- Increased potassium and hydrogen ion excretion
- Volume expansion → hypertension
- Suppressed renin (negative feedback)

### Clinical Presentation

**Symptoms**:
- Hypertension (often resistant to treatment)
- Hypokalemia-related (if severe):
  - Muscle weakness
  - Cramps
  - Paresthesias
  - Polyuria and polydipsia
  - Headaches

**Many patients normokalemic** (30-50%)

**Physical examination**:
- Elevated blood pressure
- Usually otherwise normal

**Complications**:
- Cardiovascular: LVH, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, stroke (higher risk than essential HTN)
- Renal: Proteinuria, CKD
- Metabolic: Glucose intolerance

### Diagnosis

**Screening** (consider in):
- Hypertension with hypokalemia (spontaneous or diuretic-induced)
- Resistant hypertension (≥3 drugs including diuretic)
- Adrenal incidentaloma with hypertension
- Hypertension and family history of early-onset HTN or CVA <40 years
- Hypertension in young patients (<30 years)

**Screening test**:
- **Aldosterone-to-renin ratio (ARR)**:
  - Measure plasma aldosterone concentration (PAC) and plasma renin activity (PRA) or direct renin concentration (DRC)
  - ARR >20-30 (units vary by assay) with PAC >15 ng/dL suggests PA
  - Preferred in morning, after patient upright for 2 hours

**Medication adjustments before testing**:
- Continue: CCBs, alpha-blockers, hydralazine, verapamil (least affect ARR)
- Discontinue 2-4 weeks: Spironolactone, eplerenone, amiloride
- Discontinue 2 weeks: Beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, ARBs, diuretics (confound results)
- Correct hypokalemia (suppresses aldosterone)

**Confirmatory testing** (if ARR elevated):
- **Oral sodium loading test**: High-salt diet for 3 days, measure 24-hour urine aldosterone
- **Saline infusion test**: Infuse 2 L normal saline over 4 hours, measure PAC
- **Fludrocortisone suppression test**: Less commonly used
- PA confirmed if aldosterone remains elevated despite suppression maneuvers

**Subtype differentiation** (if confirmed PA):
1. **Adrenal CT**:
   - Identify adenoma (>1 cm) or bilateral hyperplasia
   - Limitations: Nonfunctional adenomas common, microscopic APAs missed

2. **Adrenal vein sampling (AVS)**:
   - Gold standard for lateralization
   - Indicated if:
     - Patient willing to undergo adrenalectomy
     - Age <35 years or uncertain CT findings
   - Compares aldosterone/cortisol ratio from each adrenal vein
   - Lateralizing ratio >4:1 indicates unilateral disease
   - Requires expertise, not always successful

### Treatment

**Unilateral disease (APA or unilateral hyperplasia)**:
- **Laparoscopic adrenalectomy**:
  - Curative in 30-60% (HTN resolution)
  - Improves BP control in most others
  - Normalize potassium in >95%
  - Better outcomes if younger, shorter duration of HTN, fewer antihypertensives

**Bilateral disease (BAH) or not surgical candidate**:
- **Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists**:
  - Spironolactone 12.5-50 mg daily, titrate to 100-400 mg daily
    - Side effects: Gynecomastia, erectile dysfunction (men), menstrual irregularities (women)
  - Eplerenone 25-100 mg daily
    - More selective, fewer side effects, but more expensive
  - Monitor K, Cr (risk of hyperkalemia)

- **Additional antihypertensives** as needed:
  - Thiazide diuretics (caution with hypokalemia)
  - CCBs, ACE inhibitors, ARBs

- **Potassium supplementation** if hypokalemic

**Familial hyperaldosteronism type I**:
- Dexamethasone 0.125-0.5 mg daily (suppresses ACTH-driven aldosterone)

## Prognosis

### Cushing's Syndrome
- Untreated: Increased mortality (4-5 fold), median survival 4-5 years
- Post-treatment: Residual morbidity common (obesity, diabetes, osteoporosis, cardiovascular disease)
- Early diagnosis and treatment improves outcomes

### Adrenal Insufficiency
- Excellent prognosis with proper replacement therapy
- Increased mortality if inadequate treatment or adrenal crises
- Normal life expectancy with adherence and patient education

### Pheochromocytoma
- Benign: Cure rate >95% with surgery
- Malignant: 5-year survival 40-60%
- Recurrence: Monitor annually with plasma metanephrines

### Primary Hyperaldosteronism
- Increased cardiovascular morbidity compared to essential hypertension
- Surgical cure in 30-60% with unilateral disease
- Medical management effective for BP control

## Key Points

- Cushing's syndrome results from excess cortisol; diagnose with 24-hour UFC or late-night salivary cortisol, confirm with second test, determine etiology with ACTH and imaging
- Primary adrenal insufficiency (Addison's disease) presents with fatigue, weight loss, hyperpigmentation, and hyperkalemia; diagnose with cosyntropin stimulation test
- Adrenal crisis is life-threatening; treat immediately with IV hydrocortisone, fluids, and dextrose without waiting for confirmation
- Pheochromocytoma presents with paroxysmal hypertension, headache, sweating, palpitations; screen with plasma metanephrines, prepare with alpha then beta blockade before surgery
- Primary hyperaldosteronism is common in resistant hypertension; screen with aldosterone-to-renin ratio, lateralize with adrenal vein sampling before surgery
- Genetic testing recommended for all pheochromocytoma patients and young patients with adrenal disorders
