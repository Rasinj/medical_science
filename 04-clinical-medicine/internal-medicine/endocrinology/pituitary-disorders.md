# Pituitary Disorders

## Overview

The pituitary gland, often called the "master gland," is a pea-sized endocrine organ located at the base of the brain in the sella turcica. It regulates multiple physiologic processes through hormone secretion. Pituitary disorders result from hormone excess (adenomas or hyperplasia) or deficiency (hypopituitarism), and may cause mass effects such as visual field defects and headaches.

### Pituitary Anatomy and Physiology

**Anatomic structure**:
- Located in sella turcica of sphenoid bone
- Connected to hypothalamus via pituitary stalk
- Size: 5-10 mm height, 10-15 mm width
- Proximity to optic chiasm (superior)
- Cavernous sinuses laterally (contain cranial nerves III, IV, V1, V2, VI and internal carotid arteries)

**Anterior pituitary (adenohypophysis)**:
- **Growth hormone (GH)**: Promotes growth, regulates metabolism
- **Prolactin (PRL)**: Lactation, reproduction
- **ACTH**: Stimulates adrenal cortisol production
- **TSH**: Stimulates thyroid hormone production
- **LH and FSH**: Regulate gonadal function and sex hormone production

**Posterior pituitary (neurohypophysis)**:
- **Antidiuretic hormone (ADH, vasopressin)**: Water reabsorption in kidneys
- **Oxytocin**: Labor, lactation, bonding

**Hypothalamic-pituitary axes**:
- Hypothalamus produces releasing and inhibiting hormones
- TRH, CRH, GnRH, GHRH stimulate pituitary
- Dopamine inhibits prolactin
- Somatostatin inhibits GH and TSH
- Negative feedback from target hormones

### Epidemiology

- **Pituitary adenomas**: 15-20% of intracranial tumors
  - Prevalence: 1 in 1,000 in general population
  - Microadenomas (<1 cm) more common than macroadenomas (≥1 cm)
  - Peak age: 30-50 years

- **Prolactinomas**: Most common functional adenoma (40-45%)
- **Non-functioning adenomas**: 25-30%
- **GH-secreting adenomas**: 10-15%
- **ACTH-secreting adenomas**: 5-10%
- **TSH-secreting adenomas**: <1%

## Acromegaly

### Definition and Etiology

**Acromegaly**: Clinical syndrome resulting from excess growth hormone (GH) secretion in adults (after epiphyseal closure)

**Gigantism**: Excess GH before epiphyseal closure, resulting in excessive linear growth

**Causes**:
- **Pituitary adenoma** (98%): GH-secreting adenoma
  - Macroadenomas: 75%
  - Microadenomas: 25%
- **Ectopic GHRH secretion** (rare): Carcinoid tumors, pancreatic tumors
- **Ectopic GH secretion** (very rare): Pancreatic or lung tumors
- **MEN1 association**: 5% of acromegaly patients

### Pathophysiology

**GH effects**:
- Direct effects: Lipolysis, insulin resistance
- Indirect effects (via IGF-1): Growth promotion, protein synthesis
- IGF-1 (insulin-like growth factor-1): Mediates most growth-promoting effects
- Produced in liver in response to GH

**Metabolic consequences**:
- Insulin resistance and diabetes
- Hypertension
- Dyslipidemia
- Cardiovascular disease
- Increased mortality (2-3 fold) if untreated

### Clinical Presentation

**Symptoms** (insidious onset over years):
- **Acral enlargement**:
  - Hands and feet grow (ring and shoe size increase)
  - Coarse facial features
- Headaches (60-80%)
- Excessive sweating (hyperhidrosis)
- Fatigue and weakness
- Arthralgias (70%)
- Paresthesias (carpal tunnel syndrome in 50%)
- Sleep apnea (60%)
- Decreased libido, erectile dysfunction
- Menstrual irregularities

**Mass effect symptoms** (if macroadenoma):
- Visual field defects (bitemporal hemianopsia)
- Headaches
- Cranial nerve palsies (cavernous sinus invasion)

**Physical examination**:
- **Facial features**: Frontal bossing, prominent supraorbital ridge, prognathism (jaw protrusion), macroglossia
- **Acral enlargement**: Large, doughy hands and feet, wide fingers
- **Skin**: Oily, thickened skin, skin tags, acanthosis nigricans
- **Dental**: Tooth spacing, malocclusion
- **Skeletal**: Kyphosis, barrel chest
- **Cardiovascular**: Hypertension, cardiomyopathy
- **Visual field defects**: Test visual fields by confrontation

**Complications**:
- **Cardiovascular**: Cardiomyopathy, heart failure, arrhythmias, valvular disease (40-50% mortality)
- **Metabolic**: Diabetes (30-40%), hypertriglyceridemia
- **Musculoskeletal**: Osteoarthritis, carpal tunnel syndrome, myopathy
- **Respiratory**: Obstructive sleep apnea
- **Neoplastic**: Increased risk of colon polyps and cancer (require colonoscopy)
- **Mortality**: 2-3 fold increased if untreated

### Diagnosis

**Screening**:
- **IGF-1 level**:
  - Elevated for age and sex
  - Best screening test
  - Integrates GH secretion over time
  - Less variability than GH

**Confirmatory testing**:
- **Oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT)**:
  - Give 75g glucose load
  - Measure GH at 0, 30, 60, 90, 120 minutes
  - Normal: GH suppresses to <1 ng/mL (ultrasensitive assays) or <0.4 ng/mL
  - Acromegaly: GH fails to suppress, may paradoxically rise

**Additional testing**:
- Random GH: Not useful for diagnosis (pulsatile secretion)
- Prolactin: Co-secretion in 30% of GH adenomas
- Other pituitary hormones: Assess for hypopituitarism or co-secretion

**Imaging**:
- **Pituitary MRI with gadolinium**:
  - Identify and characterize adenoma
  - Assess size, extension, cavernous sinus invasion
  - 90% visible on MRI

**Assess complications**:
- Echocardiogram: Screen for cardiomyopathy, valvular disease
- Sleep study: Evaluate for sleep apnea
- Fasting glucose and HbA1c: Screen for diabetes
- Colonoscopy: Increased polyp and cancer risk
- Visual field testing: If chiasm compression suspected

### Treatment

**Goals**:
- Normalize GH and IGF-1
- Remove or reduce tumor
- Preserve pituitary function
- Relieve mass effects

**Surgical treatment** (first-line):
- **Transsphenoidal surgery (TSS)**:
  - Preferred approach
  - Cure rate: 70-80% for microadenomas, 40-50% for macroadenomas
  - Lower cure rate if cavernous sinus invasion
  - Complications: Hypopituitarism (10-20%), diabetes insipidus (transient 10%, permanent 1%), CSF leak (3%)

**Remission criteria** (postoperative):
- Random GH <1 ng/mL
- IGF-1 normal for age and sex
- GH nadir <0.4 ng/mL on OGTT

**Medical therapy** (if not cured by surgery or not surgical candidate):
1. **Somatostatin analogs** (first-line medical therapy):
   - **Octreotide LAR**: 10-40 mg IM every 4 weeks
   - **Lanreotide**: 60-120 mg SC every 4 weeks
   - Mechanism: Inhibit GH secretion
   - Efficacy: Normalize IGF-1 in 50-70%, reduce tumor size 30-50%
   - Side effects: GI (diarrhea, nausea, abdominal pain), cholelithiasis (25%), hyperglycemia

2. **Dopamine agonists**:
   - **Cabergoline**: 0.5-3.5 mg weekly (divided doses)
   - Mechanism: Inhibit GH via D2 receptors
   - Efficacy: Limited (normalize IGF-1 in 30-40%)
   - Best for GH/PRL co-secreting tumors
   - Well-tolerated

3. **GH receptor antagonist**:
   - **Pegvisomant**: 10-40 mg SC daily
   - Mechanism: Blocks GH receptor, prevents IGF-1 production
   - Efficacy: Normalizes IGF-1 in 90-95%
   - Does not reduce tumor size
   - Monitor LFTs (hepatotoxicity)
   - Expensive

**Combination therapy**:
- Somatostatin analog + pegvisomant (if inadequate response to SSA alone)
- Somatostatin analog + cabergoline

**Radiation therapy**:
- **Indications**: Residual tumor after surgery, failed medical therapy
- **Stereotactic radiosurgery** (Gamma Knife): Preferred over conventional radiation
- Efficacy: 50-60% biochemical remission at 10 years
- Slow onset (years)
- Risk of hypopituitarism (50% at 10 years)

**Monitoring**:
- IGF-1 every 3-6 months until normalized, then annually
- Pituitary MRI 3 months after surgery, then periodically
- Screen for complications: Glucose, colonoscopy, echocardiogram, sleep study

## Prolactinoma

### Definition and Etiology

**Prolactinoma**: Benign pituitary adenoma secreting prolactin (PRL)

**Classification**:
- **Microadenoma**: <1 cm (more common in women)
- **Macroadenoma**: ≥1 cm (more common in men)

**Epidemiology**:
- Most common functional pituitary adenoma
- More prevalent in women (10:1 for microadenomas)
- Peak age: 20-40 years

**Other causes of hyperprolactinemia**:
- Pregnancy and lactation (physiologic)
- Medications: Antipsychotics (risperidone, haloperidol), metoclopramide, antidepressants (SSRIs, TCAs), verapamil, opioids
- Hypothyroidism (TRH stimulates PRL)
- Pituitary stalk compression ("stalk effect" from non-functioning adenoma)
- Chronic kidney disease
- Chest wall lesions (herpes zoster, nipple stimulation)

### Pathophysiology

**Prolactin regulation**:
- Dopamine (from hypothalamus) tonically inhibits PRL secretion
- Prolactinomas: Autonomous PRL secretion
- Stalk effect: Loss of dopaminergic inhibition (PRL usually <100-150 ng/mL)

**PRL effects**:
- Stimulates lactation
- Suppresses GnRH → hypogonadotropic hypogonadism
- Decreased LH and FSH → decreased sex hormones
- Infertility, sexual dysfunction

### Clinical Presentation

**Women**:
- **Reproductive symptoms**:
  - Galactorrhea (milky nipple discharge, 80%)
  - Oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea (90%)
  - Infertility
  - Decreased libido
- **Hypogonadism**: Vaginal dryness, osteoporosis
- **Mass effects** (less common, usually microadenomas)

**Men**:
- **Hypogonadism**:
  - Erectile dysfunction (90%)
  - Decreased libido
  - Infertility, decreased sperm count
  - Gynecomastia (uncommon)
  - Galactorrhea (rare, 30%)
- **Mass effects** (common, usually present with macroadenomas):
  - Headaches
  - Visual field defects
- Often diagnosed late due to subtle symptoms

**Mass effect symptoms**:
- Headaches
- Bitemporal hemianopsia (optic chiasm compression)
- Cranial nerve palsies (cavernous sinus invasion)
- Hypopituitarism (compression of normal pituitary)

### Diagnosis

**Laboratory testing**:
- **Serum prolactin**:
  - Normal: <25 ng/mL (men), <30 ng/mL (women)
  - >200 ng/mL: Highly suggestive of prolactinoma
  - Macroadenomas: Usually >200 ng/mL, often >500 ng/mL
  - Microadenomas: Often 50-200 ng/mL
  - **Hook effect**: Very high PRL (>10,000) may show falsely low PRL; request 1:100 dilution if suspected macroadenoma with PRL <200

- **Pregnancy test**: Rule out pregnancy
- **TSH and free T4**: Rule out hypothyroidism
- **Renal function**: Rule out CKD
- **Review medications**: Exclude drug-induced hyperprolactinemia

**Macroprolactin**:
- High-molecular-weight PRL with low bioactivity
- Can cause elevated serum PRL without symptoms
- Request macroprolactin assay if asymptomatic with elevated PRL

**Imaging**:
- **Pituitary MRI with gadolinium**:
  - Identify and characterize adenoma
  - Size, extension, optic chiasm proximity
  - Perform if PRL >100 ng/mL or symptoms present
  - May be normal in microprolactinomas

**Visual field testing**: If macroadenoma or visual symptoms

### Treatment

**Indications for treatment**:
- Hypogonadism and desire to restore fertility or gonadal function
- Bothersome galactorrhea
- Macroadenoma (risk of growth and mass effects)
- Decreased bone density

**Observation**:
- Acceptable for asymptomatic microadenomas in postmenopausal women or those not desiring fertility
- Monitor PRL and MRI periodically

**Medical therapy** (first-line):
1. **Dopamine agonists**:
   - **Cabergoline** (preferred):
     - Dose: 0.25-0.5 mg once or twice weekly, titrate to 0.5-2 mg weekly
     - Efficacy: Normalizes PRL in 80-90%, tumor shrinkage in 80-90%
     - Better tolerated than bromocriptine
     - Longer half-life (once or twice weekly dosing)

   - **Bromocriptine**:
     - Dose: 1.25-2.5 mg daily, titrate to 2.5-10 mg daily (divided doses)
     - Efficacy: Normalizes PRL in 70-80%
     - More side effects than cabergoline
     - Preferred in pregnancy (longer safety data)

**Side effects**:
- Nausea, dizziness, orthostatic hypotension (start low, take with food, at bedtime)
- Nasal congestion
- High-dose cabergoline: Cardiac valvulopathy (rare at doses used for prolactinoma)

**Monitoring**:
- PRL every 1-3 months initially, then every 6-12 months once normalized
- MRI 3-6 months after starting therapy, then annually until stable
- Consider tapering or stopping after 2+ years if PRL normalized and tumor shrinkage/disappearance

**Resistance to dopamine agonists**:
- 10-20% of prolactinomas
- More common in men and macroadenomas
- Options: Increase dose, switch agonist, consider surgery

**Surgery** (transsphenoidal):
- **Indications**:
  - Intolerance or resistance to dopamine agonists
  - Patient preference
  - Apoplexy with visual compromise
  - CSF leak from dopamine agonist-induced tumor shrinkage

- **Outcomes**:
  - Microadenomas: Cure in 70-90%
  - Macroadenomas: Cure in 30-60%
  - Recurrence: 20-50% over 10 years

**Pregnancy**:
- Discontinue dopamine agonist once pregnancy confirmed (unless giant prolactinoma)
- Risk of tumor growth during pregnancy: 2-5% (microadenomas), 15-35% (macroadenomas without prior surgery/radiation)
- Monitor symptoms, visual fields
- Restart dopamine agonist if symptomatic growth
- Safe to breastfeed

## Hypopituitarism

### Definition and Etiology

**Hypopituitarism**: Deficiency of one or more pituitary hormones

**Panhypopituitarism**: Deficiency of all anterior pituitary hormones

**Causes**:
- **Tumors**: Pituitary adenomas (non-functioning, large functioning adenomas), craniopharyngiomas, meningiomas, metastases
- **Surgery or radiation**: Transsphenoidal surgery, radiation therapy
- **Vascular**: Pituitary apoplexy (hemorrhage or infarction), Sheehan's syndrome (postpartum necrosis), sickle cell disease
- **Infiltrative**: Sarcoidosis, hemochromatosis, Langerhans cell histiocytosis, lymphocytic hypophysitis
- **Trauma**: Traumatic brain injury (especially severe TBI)
- **Infection**: Meningitis, tuberculosis, syphilis
- **Genetic**: Congenital hypopituitarism (PROP1, PIT1 mutations)
- **Empty sella syndrome**: Primary (arachnoid herniation) or secondary (post-surgery, radiation)

### Pathophysiology

**Typical sequence of hormone loss**:
1. GH (often first)
2. Gonadotropins (LH, FSH)
3. TSH
4. ACTH (often last)
5. Prolactin (rare, suggests stalk damage)

**Sheehan's syndrome**:
- Postpartum pituitary necrosis
- Hypovolemic shock during delivery → ischemic necrosis
- Classic: Inability to lactate, failure to resume menses
- Can present acutely or insidiously over years

**Pituitary apoplexy**:
- Sudden hemorrhage or infarction of pituitary (usually into adenoma)
- Medical emergency
- Severe headache, visual changes, altered mental status, hypotension

### Clinical Presentation

**Symptoms depend on which hormones deficient**:

**GH deficiency** (adults):
- Decreased energy and quality of life
- Increased body fat, decreased lean mass
- Decreased bone density
- Unfavorable lipid profile
- Insulin sensitivity increased

**Gonadotropin deficiency** (secondary hypogonadism):
- Women: Amenorrhea, infertility, hot flashes, decreased libido, vaginal dryness
- Men: Erectile dysfunction, decreased libido, infertility, decreased muscle mass, gynecomastia

**TSH deficiency** (central hypothyroidism):
- Fatigue, cold intolerance, weight gain, constipation
- Milder symptoms than primary hypothyroidism

**ACTH deficiency** (central adrenal insufficiency):
- Fatigue, weakness, weight loss, nausea
- Hypoglycemia
- No hyperpigmentation (low ACTH)
- No hyperkalemia (aldosterone intact)

**Prolactin deficiency**:
- Inability to lactate postpartum
- Otherwise asymptomatic

**ADH deficiency** (central diabetes insipidus):
- Polyuria, polydipsia, nocturia
- Hypernatremia if inadequate water intake

**Mass effect symptoms**:
- Headaches
- Visual field defects

### Diagnosis

**Laboratory evaluation**:
- **Basal hormone testing**:
  - **TSH and free T4**: Central hypothyroidism shows low or inappropriately normal TSH with low free T4
  - **8 AM cortisol and ACTH**: Cortisol <3 mcg/dL diagnostic of AI; >18 mcg/dL excludes AI
  - **LH, FSH, testosterone** (men) or **LH, FSH, estradiol** (women): Low gonadotropins with low sex hormones
  - **Prolactin**: Usually low in panhypopituitarism; elevated suggests stalk compression
  - **IGF-1**: Low in GH deficiency (age-adjusted)

- **Dynamic testing**:
  - **ACTH stimulation test**: May be normal in early or partial ACTH deficiency (adrenals not atrophied)
  - **Insulin tolerance test** (ITT): Gold standard for GH and ACTH deficiency
    - Give insulin to induce hypoglycemia (glucose <40 mg/dL)
    - Measure GH and cortisol
    - Normal: GH >5 ng/mL, cortisol >18 mcg/dL
    - Contraindicated in elderly, CAD, seizure disorder
  - **Glucagon stimulation test**: Alternative to ITT for GH deficiency
  - **GnRH stimulation test**: Rarely needed

**Imaging**:
- **Pituitary MRI**: Identify structural lesions, empty sella, stalk deviation

**Visual field testing**: If mass lesion present

### Treatment

**Hormone replacement**:

1. **Cortisol (ACTH deficiency)**:
   - **Hydrocortisone** 15-25 mg daily (divided: 10-15 mg AM, 5-10 mg early afternoon)
   - Or prednisone 5 mg daily, dexamethasone 0.5 mg daily
   - Stress dosing as in primary AI
   - **Start before thyroid replacement** (can precipitate adrenal crisis)

2. **Thyroid (TSH deficiency)**:
   - **Levothyroxine** 1-1.6 mcg/kg daily
   - Monitor free T4, not TSH (already low)
   - Target free T4 in upper half of normal range

3. **Sex hormones (gonadotropin deficiency)**:
   - **Men**: Testosterone replacement (gels, patches, injections)
   - **Women**: Estrogen + progestin (if uterus present) or estrogen alone
   - **Fertility**: FSH/LH injections or pulsatile GnRH

4. **Growth hormone (GH deficiency in adults)**:
   - **Recombinant GH**: 0.2-0.5 mg SC daily at bedtime
   - Start low, titrate based on IGF-1 and side effects
   - Benefits: Improved body composition, bone density, quality of life, lipid profile
   - Side effects: Edema, arthralgias, carpal tunnel, hyperglycemia
   - Expensive, not always covered by insurance
   - Contraindications: Active malignancy

5. **ADH (central diabetes insipidus)**:
   - **Desmopressin (DDAVP)**: Intranasal, oral, or SQ
   - Titrate to symptom control and normal sodium

**Monitoring**:
- Clinic visits every 3-6 months
- Adjust doses based on symptoms and labs
- Annual pituitary MRI if structural lesion

**Pituitary apoplexy management**:
- ICU admission
- Ophthalmology and neurosurgery consult
- High-dose IV hydrocortisone (100 mg every 6-8 hours)
- Urgent surgery if:
  - Decreased visual acuity
  - Progressive visual field loss
  - Decreased consciousness
- Conservative management if stable

## Diabetes Insipidus

### Definition and Types

**Diabetes insipidus (DI)**: Disorder of water balance characterized by polyuria and polydipsia due to ADH deficiency or resistance

**Types**:
1. **Central (neurogenic) DI**: ADH deficiency
2. **Nephrogenic DI**: Renal resistance to ADH
3. **Primary polydipsia**: Excessive water intake
4. **Gestational DI**: Increased vasopressinase activity during pregnancy (rare)

### Etiology

**Central DI**:
- **Idiopathic** (30-50%)
- **Tumors**: Craniopharyngioma, germinoma, metastases
- **Surgery**: Transsphenoidal surgery (10-20%, usually transient)
- **Trauma**: Head injury, skull fracture
- **Infiltrative**: Sarcoidosis, Langerhans cell histiocytosis, lymphocytic infundibuloneurohypophysitis
- **Vascular**: Pituitary apoplexy, Sheehan's syndrome
- **Genetic**: Autosomal dominant (AVP gene mutations)
- **Infection**: Meningitis, encephalitis

**Nephrogenic DI**:
- **Medications**: Lithium (most common), demeclocycline, foscarnet, amphotericin B
- **Electrolytes**: Hypercalcemia, hypokalemia
- **Chronic kidney disease**
- **Obstructive uropathy**
- **Genetic**: X-linked (AVPR2 mutations), autosomal recessive (AQP2 mutations)

**Primary polydipsia**:
- Psychiatric disorders (schizophrenia)
- Hypothalamic lesions affecting thirst center
- Medications (anticholinergics, SSRIs)

### Pathophysiology

**ADH (vasopressin) physiology**:
- Produced in hypothalamus, stored in posterior pituitary
- Released in response to increased plasma osmolality or decreased blood volume
- Acts on V2 receptors in kidney collecting ducts
- Increases water reabsorption via aquaporin-2 channels
- Normal plasma osmolality: 280-295 mOsm/kg

**Central DI**: Lack of ADH → inability to concentrate urine
**Nephrogenic DI**: Kidneys unresponsive to ADH
**Primary polydipsia**: Excessive water intake → suppressed ADH → dilute urine

### Clinical Presentation

**Symptoms**:
- Polyuria: Urine output >3 L/day (often 5-20 L/day)
- Polydipsia: Compensatory water intake
- Nocturia and disrupted sleep
- Preference for cold water or ice
- Dehydration if inadequate intake (infants, altered mental status)
- Hypernatremia (if water intake inadequate)

**Physical examination**:
- Usually normal if able to drink freely
- Signs of dehydration if water restricted
- Evaluate for underlying cause

### Diagnosis

**Initial labs**:
- **Serum sodium and osmolality**: May be high-normal or elevated
- **Urine osmolality**: Inappropriately dilute (<300 mOsm/kg) despite hypernatremia
- **Urine specific gravity**: Low (<1.005)
- **24-hour urine volume**: >3 L/day (often much higher)

**Differential diagnosis approach**:
- Polyuria with dilute urine and hypernatremia → DI likely
- Polyuria with dilute urine and hyponatremia → Primary polydipsia likely

**Water deprivation test** (if diagnosis unclear):
- **Purpose**: Distinguish central DI, nephrogenic DI, and primary polydipsia
- **Contraindications**: Hypernatremia, severe polyuria, unstable patient
- **Protocol**:
  1. Baseline: Weight, serum sodium, osmolality, urine osmolality
  2. Withhold fluids
  3. Measure hourly urine volume, osmolality; every 2 hours serum osmolality, sodium
  4. Continue until:
     - Urine osmolality plateaus (3 consecutive values <30 mOsm/kg change)
     - Weight loss >3-5%
     - Serum osmolality >295-300 mOsm/kg
     - Serum sodium >145 mEq/L
  5. Give desmopressin 2-4 mcg SC or IV
  6. Measure urine osmolality 1-2 hours later

- **Interpretation**:
  - **Normal**: Urine osmolality >600 mOsm/kg after dehydration
  - **Central DI**: Urine osmolality <300 mOsm/kg after dehydration, increases >50% after desmopressin
  - **Nephrogenic DI**: Urine osmolality <300 mOsm/kg after dehydration, minimal increase (<50%) after desmopressin
  - **Primary polydipsia**: Urine osmolality 300-600 mOsm/kg after dehydration, minimal increase after desmopressin
  - **Partial central DI**: Intermediate response

**Imaging**:
- **Brain MRI**: Evaluate for structural lesions
  - Loss of posterior pituitary bright spot on T1 (normal hyperintensity) suggests central DI
  - Assess for tumors, infiltrative disease

### Treatment

**Central DI**:
- **Desmopressin (DDAVP)**:
  - **Intranasal**: 5-20 mcg once or twice daily
  - **Oral**: 0.1-0.4 mg 2-3 times daily
  - **Subcutaneous/IV**: 1-4 mcg once or twice daily
  - Titrate to reduce polyuria and maintain normal sodium
  - Allow breakthrough polyuria once daily to prevent hyponatremia
  - Monitor serum sodium regularly

**Nephrogenic DI**:
- Treat underlying cause (stop lithium, correct electrolytes)
- **Thiazide diuretics** + **amiloride**:
  - Paradoxical decrease in urine output
  - Hydrochlorothiazide 25-50 mg daily
  - Amiloride 5-10 mg daily (blocks lithium entry into collecting duct cells)
- **NSAIDs** (indomethacin): Decrease urine output by reducing GFR
- Low-sodium, low-protein diet
- Adequate hydration

**Primary polydipsia**:
- Behavioral modification
- Treat underlying psychiatric condition
- Fluid restriction
- Avoid desmopressin (risk of hyponatremia)

**Monitoring**:
- Serum sodium every 1-3 months
- Adjust desmopressin dose based on symptoms and sodium
- Watch for hyponatremia (overtreatment)

## Prognosis

### Acromegaly
- Untreated: 2-3 fold increased mortality, reduced life expectancy by 10-15 years
- Normalized GH/IGF-1: Mortality returns to general population
- Residual morbidity: Arthritis, sleep apnea, cardiovascular disease

### Prolactinoma
- Benign, excellent prognosis with treatment
- Dopamine agonists: 80-90% normalize PRL, tumor shrinkage
- Microadenomas: Often stable, may regress spontaneously in postmenopausal women

### Hypopituitarism
- Lifelong hormone replacement required
- Normal life expectancy with adequate treatment
- Increased mortality if ACTH deficiency untreated or under-treated

### Diabetes Insipidus
- Good prognosis with treatment
- Central DI: Excellent response to desmopressin
- Nephrogenic DI: More difficult to manage, may have persistent polyuria

## Key Points

- Acromegaly results from GH excess; diagnose with elevated IGF-1 and lack of GH suppression on OGTT; treat with surgery, somatostatin analogs, or GH receptor antagonists
- Prolactinomas are the most common functional pituitary adenomas; dopamine agonists (cabergoline) are first-line treatment with high efficacy
- Hypopituitarism requires replacement of deficient hormones; always replace cortisol before thyroid hormone to avoid precipitating adrenal crisis
- Diabetes insipidus presents with polyuria and polydipsia; distinguish central from nephrogenic DI with water deprivation test and desmopressin response
- Pituitary apoplexy is an endocrine emergency requiring urgent evaluation and high-dose steroids; surgery indicated for visual compromise
- All patients with pituitary lesions require comprehensive evaluation for hormone excess and deficiency, plus assessment for mass effects including visual field testing
