# Diabetes Mellitus

## Overview

Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a group of metabolic disorders characterized by chronic hyperglycemia resulting from defects in insulin secretion, insulin action, or both. It is one of the most common chronic diseases worldwide, affecting over 537 million adults globally, with prevalence projected to reach 783 million by 2045. Diabetes leads to significant morbidity and mortality through its acute complications and chronic microvascular and macrovascular sequelae.

### Classification

**Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM)**:
- Autoimmune destruction of pancreatic beta cells
- Absolute insulin deficiency
- Usually presents in childhood or adolescence
- Accounts for 5-10% of all diabetes cases
- Requires lifelong insulin therapy

**Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM)**:
- Insulin resistance with progressive beta cell dysfunction
- Relative insulin deficiency
- Usually presents in adults, increasingly in children
- Accounts for 90-95% of all diabetes cases
- Strongly associated with obesity and sedentary lifestyle

**Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM)**:
- Glucose intolerance first recognized during pregnancy
- Affects 2-10% of pregnancies
- Increases risk for T2DM later in life

**Other specific types**:
- Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY)
- Secondary diabetes: Pancreatitis, cystic fibrosis, hemochromatosis
- Drug-induced: Glucocorticoids, antipsychotics, antiretrovirals
- Endocrinopathies: Cushing's syndrome, acromegaly, pheochromocytoma

### Epidemiology

- Global prevalence: 10.5% of adults (20-79 years)
- United States: 37.3 million people (11.3% of population)
- Undiagnosed diabetes: ~25% of cases
- Prediabetes: 96 million US adults (38% of adult population)
- Leading cause of blindness, kidney failure, and non-traumatic amputation
- Major risk factor for cardiovascular disease and stroke
- Economic burden: $327 billion annually in the US (direct and indirect costs)

### Diagnostic Criteria (American Diabetes Association)

**Diabetes mellitus** (any one of the following):
- Fasting plasma glucose ≥126 mg/dL (7.0 mmol/L)
- 2-hour plasma glucose ≥200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) during OGTT
- HbA1c ≥6.5% (48 mmol/mol)
- Random plasma glucose ≥200 mg/dL with classic symptoms

**Prediabetes** (any one of the following):
- Fasting plasma glucose 100-125 mg/dL (impaired fasting glucose)
- 2-hour plasma glucose 140-199 mg/dL during OGTT (impaired glucose tolerance)
- HbA1c 5.7-6.4%

*Note: Diagnosis requires confirmation with repeat testing unless unequivocal hyperglycemia with acute metabolic decompensation*

## Pathophysiology

### Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus

**Autoimmune destruction**:
- T-cell mediated destruction of pancreatic beta cells
- Genetic susceptibility: HLA-DR3, HLA-DR4, HLA-DQ
- Environmental triggers: Viral infections (enteroviruses), dietary factors
- Islet autoantibodies: GAD, IA-2, ZnT8, insulin autoantibodies
- Progressive loss of beta cells over months to years
- Clinical onset when >90% of beta cells destroyed

**Metabolic consequences**:
- Absolute insulin deficiency
- Unopposed glucagon action
- Hepatic glucose production increased
- Peripheral glucose uptake decreased
- Lipolysis and ketogenesis → diabetic ketoacidosis
- Protein catabolism and weight loss

**Honeymoon phase**:
- Temporary improvement in beta cell function after diagnosis
- Reduced insulin requirements
- Lasts weeks to months
- Eventually progresses to complete insulin deficiency

### Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus

**Insulin resistance**:
- Decreased tissue sensitivity to insulin
- Compensatory hyperinsulinemia
- Associated with obesity (especially visceral adiposity)
- Mechanisms: Receptor and post-receptor defects
- Inflammatory cytokines: TNF-alpha, IL-6
- Free fatty acids impair insulin signaling
- Ectopic lipid accumulation in muscle and liver

**Beta cell dysfunction**:
- Progressive decline in insulin secretion
- Loss of first-phase insulin response
- Amyloid deposition (islet amyloid polypeptide)
- Chronic hyperglycemia (glucotoxicity)
- Chronic hyperlipidemia (lipotoxicity)
- Genetic factors: TCF7L2, KCNJ11, PPARG

**Natural history**:
1. Insulin resistance with compensatory hyperinsulinemia
2. Impaired glucose tolerance (prediabetes)
3. Overt diabetes with maintained insulin secretion
4. Progressive beta cell failure requiring insulin

### Gestational Diabetes Mellitus

**Pathophysiology**:
- Pregnancy-induced insulin resistance
- Placental hormones: hPL, cortisol, progesterone
- Insufficient compensatory insulin secretion
- Usually resolves after delivery
- Identifies women at high risk for future T2DM

## Clinical Presentation

### Type 1 Diabetes

**Classic symptoms** (often acute onset):
- Polyuria (osmotic diuresis from glycosuria)
- Polydipsia (compensatory water intake)
- Polyphagia (cellular starvation despite hyperglycemia)
- Weight loss (loss of anabolic effects of insulin)
- Fatigue and weakness
- Blurred vision (osmotic changes in lens)

**Severe presentation**:
- Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) at diagnosis in 25-30%
- Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain
- Kussmaul respirations (deep, rapid breathing)
- Fruity breath odor (acetone)
- Altered mental status or coma

**Physical examination**:
- Dehydration: Dry mucous membranes, poor skin turgor
- Tachycardia and hypotension (if DKA)
- Ketotic breath

## Diagnosis

### Screening Recommendations

**Type 1 diabetes**:
- No routine screening recommended
- Consider antibody screening in first-degree relatives
- Emerging role for genetic risk screening

**Type 2 diabetes**:
- Universal screening starting at age 35 years
- Earlier screening if risk factors present:
  - Overweight/obesity (BMI ≥25 kg/m² or ≥23 kg/m² in Asian Americans)
  - First-degree relative with diabetes
  - High-risk ethnicity (African American, Latino, Native American, Asian American, Pacific Islander)
  - History of cardiovascular disease
  - Hypertension (≥140/90 mmHg or on therapy)
  - HDL <35 mg/dL or triglycerides >250 mg/dL
  - PCOS
  - Physical inactivity
  - Previous GDM or baby >9 lbs
- Repeat screening every 3 years if normal

**Gestational diabetes**:
- Screen all pregnant women at 24-28 weeks
- One-step approach: 75g OGTT
- Two-step approach: 50g glucose challenge, then 100g OGTT if abnormal

### Laboratory Evaluation

**Initial testing**:
- Fasting plasma glucose
- HbA1c
- Consider OGTT if borderline results

**Confirming type**:
- C-peptide: Low/absent in T1DM, normal/high in T2DM
- Autoantibodies (T1DM): GAD65, IA-2, ZnT8, insulin autoantibodies
- Consider if age <30, lean body habitus, or ketosis-prone

**Baseline assessment**:
- Comprehensive metabolic panel (renal function, electrolytes)
- Lipid panel
- Urinalysis and urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio
- TSH (higher prevalence of thyroid disease in T1DM)
- Liver function tests (before statin therapy)

**Monitoring**:
- HbA1c every 3 months until target achieved, then every 6 months
- Self-monitoring blood glucose (frequency depends on treatment)
- Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) in T1DM and insulin-treated T2DM

## Treatment

### Type 1 Diabetes Management

**Insulin therapy** (required):
- **Basal-bolus regimen** (preferred):
  - Long-acting basal: Glargine, detemir, degludec (once or twice daily)
  - Rapid-acting bolus: Lispro, aspart, glulisine (before meals)
  - Total daily dose: 0.5-1.0 units/kg
  - 50% basal, 50% bolus (divided among meals)

- **Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (insulin pump)**:
  - Delivers continuous basal insulin
  - Bolus doses programmed for meals
  - More physiologic insulin delivery
  - Allows for precise dosing adjustments

- **Automated insulin delivery systems** (hybrid closed-loop):
  - CGM-integrated insulin pumps
  - Algorithm-driven basal rate adjustments
  - Improved glycemic control and reduced hypoglycemia

**Carbohydrate counting**:
- Estimate carbohydrates in meals
- Calculate insulin-to-carb ratio (e.g., 1 unit per 10g carbs)
- Adjust bolus insulin accordingly
- Requires education and practice

**Correction doses**:
- Insulin sensitivity factor (1 unit drops glucose by X mg/dL)
- Correct pre-meal hyperglycemia
- Target glucose: 80-130 mg/dL pre-meal

**Adjunctive therapy**:
- Pramlintide: Amylin analog, reduces postprandial glucose
- Metformin: May improve insulin sensitivity in overweight T1DM

**Hypoglycemia management**:
- Recognize symptoms: Tremor, sweating, palpitations, confusion
- Rule of 15: 15g fast-acting carbs, recheck in 15 minutes
- Glucagon emergency kit for severe hypoglycemia

### Type 2 Diabetes Management

**Glycemic targets** (individualized):
- HbA1c <7% for most adults
- More stringent (<6.5%) if achieved without hypoglycemia
- Less stringent (<8%) in elderly, limited life expectancy, hypoglycemia risk

**Lifestyle modifications** (first-line):
- Medical nutrition therapy: Calorie reduction, carbohydrate control
- Physical activity: 150 minutes/week moderate-intensity aerobic exercise
- Weight loss: 5-10% body weight can significantly improve glycemic control
- Smoking cessation

**Pharmacologic therapy**:

**First-line: Metformin**
- Mechanism: Decreases hepatic glucose production, improves insulin sensitivity
- Dose: 500-2000 mg daily (extended-release for GI tolerance)
- Benefits: Weight neutral, low hypoglycemia risk, cardiovascular benefits
- Side effects: GI upset (diarrhea, nausea), vitamin B12 deficiency
- Contraindications: eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73m², severe liver disease

**ASCVD or high CV risk: Add GLP-1 agonist or SGLT2 inhibitor**
- **GLP-1 receptor agonists**: Liraglutide, semaglutide, dulaglutide

  - Side effects: Nausea, vomiting, pancreatitis (rare)
  - Route: Subcutaneous injection (daily or weekly)

- **SGLT2 inhibitors**: Empagliflozin, dapagliflozin, canagliflozin
  - Mechanism: Inhibit renal glucose reabsorption
  - Benefits: Weight loss, BP reduction, CV and renal protection
  - Side effects: Genital mycotic infections, UTIs, DKA (rare), lower limb amputation (canagliflozin)

**Heart failure or CKD: SGLT2 inhibitor preferred**
- Reduces heart failure hospitalization
- Slows CKD progression
- Renal protection independent of glycemic effects

**If HbA1c not at goal, add additional agents**:
- **DPP-4 inhibitors**: Sitagliptin, linagliptin, saxagliptin
  - Mechanism: Enhance incretin levels
  - Benefits: Weight neutral, low hypoglycemia risk, oral
  - Modest HbA1c reduction (~0.5-0.8%)

- **Sulfonylureas**: Glipizide, glyburide, glimepiride
  - Mechanism: Stimulate insulin secretion
  - Benefits: Effective, inexpensive
  - Risks: Hypoglycemia, weight gain
  - Avoid in elderly and those with CKD

- **Thiazolidinediones (TZDs)**: Pioglitazone
  - Mechanism: Improve insulin sensitivity (PPAR-gamma agonist)
  - Benefits: Durable glycemic control
  - Risks: Weight gain, edema, heart failure, fractures, bladder cancer

**Insulin therapy**:
- Indicated if HbA1c >10%, symptomatic hyperglycemia, or other agents insufficient
- **Basal insulin**: Glargine, detemir, degludec
  - Start 10 units or 0.1-0.2 units/kg daily at bedtime
  - Titrate by 10-15% or 2-4 units every 3 days based on fasting glucose
  - Target fasting glucose 80-130 mg/dL

- **Basal-bolus regimen**: Add prandial insulin if basal insulin optimized but HbA1c not at goal

- 1-hour postprandial <140 mg/dL
- 2-hour postprandial <120 mg/dL

**Treatment**:
- Medical nutrition therapy and exercise (first-line)
- Insulin if targets not met (traditional first-line pharmacotherapy)
- Metformin or glyburide (alternatives, off-label)
- Frequent monitoring (fasting and postprandial glucose)
- Fetal surveillance (ultrasounds, NSTs)

**Postpartum**:
- Screen at 4-12 weeks postpartum with 75g OGTT
- Long-term screening for T2DM every 1-3 years

## Acute Complications

- Severe: pH <7.0, bicarbonate <10, stupor or coma

**Management**:
1. **Fluid resuscitation**:
   - 0.9% NaCl 1-1.5 L in first hour
   - Continue 250-500 mL/hr, adjust based on hydration status
   - Switch to 0.45% NaCl if corrected sodium elevated
   - Add dextrose when glucose <200 mg/dL

2. **Insulin therapy**:
   - IV regular insulin 0.1 units/kg/hr continuous infusion
   - Bolus no longer routinely recommended
   - Decrease to 0.05 units/kg/hr when glucose <200 mg/dL
   - Continue until anion gap closes and patient can eat

3. **Electrolyte replacement**:
   - Potassium: Add to fluids once K >3.3 mEq/L and adequate urine output

- Adjust medications if recurrent hypoglycemia

## Chronic Complications

### Microvascular Complications

**Diabetic retinopathy**:
- Leading cause of blindness in working-age adults
- Prevalence increases with duration of diabetes
- Non-proliferative retinopathy: Microaneurysms, hemorrhages, exudates
- Proliferative retinopathy: Neovascularization, vitreous hemorrhage, retinal detachment
- Diabetic macular edema: Can occur at any stage
- Screening: Annual dilated eye exam starting at diagnosis (T2DM) or 5 years after diagnosis (T1DM)
- Treatment: Laser photocoagulation, anti-VEGF injections, vitrectomy

**Diabetic nephropathy**:
- Leading cause of end-stage renal disease
- Progression: Hyperfiltration → microalbuminuria → macroalbuminuria → declining GFR → ESRD
- Screening: Annual urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio and serum creatinine/eGFR
- Albuminuria categories: <30 mg/g (normal), 30-300 mg/g (moderately increased), >300 mg/g (severely increased)
- Prevention/treatment: Glycemic control, BP control (<130/80), ACE inhibitor or ARB, SGLT2 inhibitor
- Dialysis or transplantation for ESRD

**Diabetic neuropathy**:
- **Distal symmetric polyneuropathy** (most common):
  - "Stocking-glove" pattern sensory loss
  - Neuropathic pain: Burning, tingling, hyperesthesia (worse at night)
  - Loss of protective sensation increases ulcer and amputation risk
  - Screening: Annual foot exam with 10g monofilament and vibration (128 Hz tuning fork)
  - Treatment: Glycemic control, pregabalin, duloxetine, gabapentin, tricyclic antidepressants

- **Autonomic neuropathy**:
  - Cardiovascular: Resting tachycardia, orthostatic hypotension, silent MI
  - Gastrointestinal: Gastroparesis, constipation, diarrhea
  - Genitourinary: Erectile dysfunction, neurogenic bladder
  - Hypoglycemia unawareness

- **Focal neuropathies**: Cranial nerve palsies (III, VI), mononeuropathies

### Macrovascular Complications

**Cardiovascular disease**:
- 2-4 fold increased risk compared to non-diabetics
- Coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction
- Often atypical presentation (silent ischemia)
- Aggressive risk factor modification: Statin therapy, BP control, antiplatelet therapy
- Consider aspirin 75-162 mg for secondary prevention

**Cerebrovascular disease**:
- 2-fold increased stroke risk
- Transient ischemic attacks and ischemic strokes
- Intensive BP and lipid control

**Peripheral arterial disease**:
- Increased risk of claudication and critical limb ischemia
- Combined with neuropathy increases amputation risk
- Screening: Ankle-brachial index, foot pulses
- Vascular surgery consultation if severe

### Diabetic Foot Disease

**Risk factors**:
- Peripheral neuropathy (loss of protective sensation)
- Peripheral arterial disease
- Foot deformities
- History of foot ulcers
- Poor glycemic control

**Prevention**:
- Daily foot inspection
- Proper footwear
- Podiatry referral for high-risk patients
- Patient education

**Ulcer management**:
- Offloading (total contact cast, walking boot)
- Wound care and debridement
- Infection control (antibiotics if infected)
- Vascular assessment (revascularization if needed)
- Multidisciplinary approach

## Prognosis

### Life Expectancy
- T1DM: 10-13 years reduced life expectancy if diagnosed in childhood
- T2DM: 5-10 years reduced life expectancy
- Largely due to cardiovascular disease
- Improved outcomes with intensive glycemic control and CV risk reduction

### Complications Timeline
- Microvascular complications: Usually after 5-10 years of diabetes
- Macrovascular disease: Can be present at T2DM diagnosis
- Intensive control delays microvascular complications by 40-70%

### DCCT and UKPDS Trials
- **DCCT** (T1DM): Intensive glycemic control reduced microvascular complications by 50-76%
- **UKPDS** (T2DM): Each 1% reduction in HbA1c reduced microvascular complications by 37%, MI by 14%
- Legacy effect: Early intensive control provides long-term benefits

### Mortality
- Cardiovascular disease accounts for 50% of deaths
- HbA1c >9%: 2-3 fold increased mortality
- Multifactorial intervention (glycemic, BP, lipid control) reduces CV events by 50%

## Key Points

- Diabetes mellitus is characterized by chronic hyperglycemia due to insulin deficiency (T1DM) or insulin resistance and progressive beta cell dysfunction (T2DM)
- Diagnosis requires fasting glucose ≥126 mg/dL, 2-hour OGTT ≥200 mg/dL, or HbA1c ≥6.5% on two occasions
- T1DM requires lifelong insulin therapy; T2DM is managed with lifestyle modification and stepwise pharmacotherapy based on comorbidities
- GLP-1 agonists and SGLT2 inhibitors provide cardiovascular and renal benefits beyond glycemic control
- DKA and HHS are life-threatening acute complications requiring urgent treatment with fluids, insulin, and electrolyte replacement
- Chronic complications include microvascular (retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy) and macrovascular (CAD, stroke, PAD) disease
- Intensive glycemic control (HbA1c <7%) reduces microvascular complications; individualize targets based on patient factors
- Comprehensive diabetes care includes screening for complications, cardiovascular risk reduction, and patient education
