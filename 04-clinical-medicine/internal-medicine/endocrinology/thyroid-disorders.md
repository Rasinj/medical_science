# Thyroid Disorders

## Overview

Thyroid disorders are among the most common endocrine conditions, affecting approximately 5-10% of the general population. The thyroid gland produces thyroid hormones that regulate metabolism, growth, and development. Thyroid dysfunction can manifest as hormone excess (hyperthyroidism), deficiency (hypothyroidism), structural abnormalities (nodules, goiter), or malignancy (thyroid cancer).

### Thyroid Anatomy and Physiology

**Gland structure**:
- Butterfly-shaped gland in anterior neck
- Two lobes connected by isthmus
- Located below thyroid cartilage, anterior to trachea
- Weight: 15-20 grams in adults
- Highly vascularized (superior and inferior thyroid arteries)

**Thyroid hormone synthesis**:
1. Iodide uptake via sodium-iodide symporter (NIS)
2. Oxidation of iodide by thyroid peroxidase (TPO)
3. Iodination of thyroglobulin tyrosine residues
4. Coupling of MIT and DIT to form T3 and T4
5. Storage in colloid
6. Proteolysis and release of T3 and T4

**Thyroid hormones**:
- **Thyroxine (T4)**: Main secretory product (80-90%)
- **Triiodothyronine (T3)**: Most biologically active (10-20% secreted, 80% from peripheral conversion)
- T3 is 3-4 times more potent than T4
- 99% protein-bound (TBG, albumin, prealbumin)
- Free (unbound) hormone is biologically active

**Regulation (HPT axis)**:
- Hypothalamus → TRH (thyrotropin-releasing hormone)
- Pituitary → TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone)
- Thyroid → T3 and T4
- Negative feedback: T3/T4 suppress TSH and TRH
- TSH is most sensitive marker of thyroid function

### Epidemiology

**Hypothyroidism**:
- Prevalence: 4-10% of adults
- More common in women (7:1 ratio)
- Increases with age
- Subclinical hypothyroidism: 4-20% of adults

**Hyperthyroidism**:
- Prevalence: 1.3% of US population
- More common in women (5-10:1 ratio)
- Graves' disease: Most common cause (60-80%)

**Thyroid nodules**:
- Prevalence: 19-68% on ultrasound
- Palpable in 5-7% of adults
- 90-95% benign
- Higher prevalence with age and in women

**Thyroid cancer**:
- Incidence: 14.5 per 100,000 in US
- 3:1 female predominance
- Papillary thyroid cancer: 80-85% of cases
- Increasing incidence (partly due to increased detection)

## Hypothyroidism

### Etiology

**Primary hypothyroidism** (>95% of cases):
- **Autoimmune (Hashimoto's thyroiditis)**: Most common in iodine-sufficient areas
  - Anti-TPO antibodies (90%)
  - Anti-thyroglobulin antibodies (50%)
  - Lymphocytic infiltration and follicular destruction

- **Iatrogenic**:
  - Radioactive iodine therapy
  - Thyroidectomy
  - External beam radiation
  - Medications: Lithium, amiodarone, interferon-alpha, tyrosine kinase inhibitors

- **Iodine deficiency**: Most common worldwide
- **Infiltrative diseases**: Sarcoidosis, hemochromatosis, scleroderma
- **Congenital**: Thyroid dysgenesis, dyshormonogenesis

**Central hypothyroidism** (<5% of cases):
- **Secondary**: Pituitary TSH deficiency
  - Pituitary tumors, apoplexy, surgery, radiation
  - Sheehan's syndrome (postpartum pituitary necrosis)

- **Tertiary**: Hypothalamic TRH deficiency

  - Low free T4 (<0.8 ng/dL)
  - Normal to low T3 (less sensitive)

- **Subclinical hypothyroidism**:
  - Elevated TSH (4.5-10 mIU/L)
  - Normal free T4
  - May be transient; recheck in 2-3 months

- **Central hypothyroidism**:
  - Low or inappropriately normal TSH
  - Low free T4
  - Requires pituitary MRI and other pituitary hormone assessment

**Additional testing**:
- Anti-TPO antibodies: Confirm Hashimoto's thyroiditis
- Anti-thyroglobulin antibodies
- Lipid panel (often elevated cholesterol and LDL)
- CBC (may have anemia)
- CK (may be elevated)

### Treatment

**Levothyroxine (T4)**:
- Standard treatment for hypothyroidism
- Starting dose: 1.6 mcg/kg/day (healthy adults)
  - Lower starting doses in elderly or CAD: 25-50 mcg/day
- Taken on empty stomach, 30-60 minutes before breakfast
- Check TSH 6-8 weeks after initiation or dose change
- Target TSH: 0.5-2.5 mIU/L for most patients
- Adjust dose by 12.5-25 mcg increments

**Special populations**:
- **Pregnancy**: Increase dose by 20-30% once pregnant
  - Target TSH <2.5 mIU/L in first trimester, <3.0 in later trimesters
  - Check TSH every 4 weeks

- **Elderly**: Lower doses, slower titration
- **Cardiac disease**: Start low (25 mcg), increase slowly
- **Subclinical hypothyroidism**: Treat if TSH >10, symptomatic, or pregnant/planning pregnancy

**Factors affecting absorption**:
- Medications: Calcium, iron, PPIs, bile acid sequestrants (space 4 hours apart)
- Foods: Soy, fiber (space 30-60 minutes)
- Malabsorption: Celiac disease, IBD, atrophic gastritis

**T3 therapy**:
- Not routinely recommended
- Consider combination T4/T3 in select patients with persistent symptoms
- Controversial; limited evidence for benefit

**Monitoring**:
- TSH 6-8 weeks after dose changes
- Once stable, check TSH annually
- Check more frequently if pregnant or dose adjusted

- Atenolol 25-100 mg daily
- Metoprolol 25-50 mg twice daily
- Initiate immediately for symptom control

**Antithyroid drugs (ATDs)**:
- **Methimazole** (preferred):
  - Dose: 5-30 mg daily (higher doses for severe hyperthyroidism)
  - Longer half-life allows once-daily dosing
  - More potent than PTU
  - Contraindicated in first trimester pregnancy (teratogenic)

- **Propylthiouracil (PTU)**:
  - Dose: 50-150 mg three times daily
  - Preferred in first trimester pregnancy and thyroid storm
  - Higher risk of hepatotoxicity
  - Blocks peripheral T4 to T3 conversion

**Duration and monitoring**:
- Check free T4 and T3 every 4-6 weeks initially
- Once euthyroid, check every 2-3 months
- Graves' disease: Treat for 12-18 months, then attempt withdrawal
  - Remission rate: 30-50% after 12-18 months
  - Lower TRAb levels predict higher remission rate

**Side effects of ATDs**:

- Dose: 10-15 mCi for Graves', higher for nodular disease
- Outcome: 80-90% euthyroid or hypothyroid at 6-12 months
- Requires lifelong levothyroxine in most patients
- Pretreatment: Stop ATDs 5-7 days before RAI
- Posttreatment: Resume ATDs if needed, monitor thyroid function

**Thyroidectomy**:
- **Indications**:
  - Large goiter with compressive symptoms
  - Suspicion for malignancy

  - Hypothyroidism (100% if total thyroidectomy)
  - Recurrent laryngeal nerve injury (1-2%, voice changes)
  - Hypoparathyroidism (transient 10%, permanent 1-2%)
  - Bleeding and hematoma

**Treatment by etiology**:
- **Graves' disease**: ATDs, RAI, or surgery (patient choice)
- **Toxic nodular disease**: RAI or surgery (ATDs not curative)
- **Thyroiditis**: Beta-blockers only (self-limited, avoid ATDs)
- **Amiodarone-induced**:
  - Type 1: ATDs + perchlorate
  - Type 2: Corticosteroids
  - Mixed: Combination therapy

**Graves' ophthalmopathy management**:
- Mild: Artificial tears, selenium supplementation
- Moderate-severe: High-dose corticosteroids, orbital radiotherapy
- Severe/sight-threatening: IV methylprednisolone, orbital decompression surgery
- Smoking cessation essential
- RAI may worsen; consider prophylactic steroids

### Thyroid Storm

**Definition**: Life-threatening thyrotoxicosis with multisystem decompensation

**Precipitants**:
- Infection or sepsis
- Surgery or trauma
- Diabetic ketoacidosis
- RAI treatment
- Medication non-adherence
- Stroke or MI

**Clinical features** (Burch-Wartofsky score):

- Severe tachycardia (>140 bpm) or atrial fibrillation
- CNS dysfunction: Agitation, delirium, psychosis, seizures, coma
- GI symptoms: Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, jaundice
- Heart failure
- Hypotension and shock (advanced)

**Diagnosis**:
- Clinical diagnosis (cannot wait for lab results)
- Elevated free T4 and T3, suppressed TSH
- Often similar hormone levels to uncomplicated hyperthyroidism

**Management** (requires ICU):
1. **Block thyroid hormone synthesis**:
   - PTU 500-1000 mg loading, then 250 mg every 4 hours (preferred over methimazole)
   - Or methimazole 20 mg every 4-6 hours (oral, rectal, or NG)

2. **Block thyroid hormone release** (give 1 hour after ATD):
   - Saturated solution of potassium iodide (SSKI) 5 drops every 6 hours
   - Or Lugol's solution 10 drops every 8 hours
   - Or sodium iodide 500-1000 mg IV every 8 hours

3. **Block peripheral T4 to T3 conversion**:
   - Propranolol 60-80 mg every 4-6 hours (or esmolol infusion)
   - Hydrocortisone 100 mg IV every 8 hours (also treats potential adrenal insufficiency)

4. **Supportive care**:
   - Aggressive cooling (avoid aspirin, increases free T4)
   - IV fluids and electrolyte replacement
   - Treat precipitating cause (antibiotics if infection)
   - Nutritional support

5. **Consider additional therapies**:
   - Cholestyramine 4 g every 6 hours (blocks enterohepatic circulation)

**Mortality**: 10-30% even with treatment

## Thyroid Nodules

### Epidemiology and Risk Factors

**Prevalence**:
- Palpable: 5-7% of adults
- Ultrasound: 19-68% of adults
- Increases with age, more common in women

**Risk factors for malignancy**:
- History of head/neck radiation
- Family history of thyroid cancer or MEN2
- Age <20 or >70 years
- Male sex
- Rapidly growing nodule
- Hoarseness or vocal cord paralysis
- Hard, fixed nodule
- Cervical lymphadenopathy

### Evaluation

**Initial assessment**:
- TSH (first test):
  - If low: Consider toxic nodule (RAIU scan, rarely requires biopsy)
  - If normal or high: Proceed with ultrasound

**Thyroid ultrasound**:
- Characterize nodule size and features
- Evaluate for additional nodules
- Assess cervical lymph nodes

**Ultrasound features and malignancy risk** (ATA classification):
- **High suspicion** (70-90% malignancy):
  - Hypoechoic solid nodule with irregular margins, microcalcifications, taller-than-wide, extrathyroidal extension

- **Intermediate suspicion** (10-20%):
  - Hypoechoic solid nodule without high-risk features

- **Low suspicion** (5-10%):
  - Isoechoic or hyperechoic, solid, regular margins

- **Very low suspicion** (1-3%):
  - Spongiform or partially cystic

- **Benign** (<1%):
  - Purely cystic

**Fine needle aspiration (FNA) indications**:
- Nodules ≥1 cm with high or intermediate suspicion features
- Nodules ≥1.5 cm with low suspicion features
- Nodules ≥2 cm with very low suspicion features
- Any size if high-risk patient or suspicious lymph nodes

**FNA cytology** (Bethesda classification):
- **I. Non-diagnostic**: Repeat FNA with ultrasound guidance
- **II. Benign** (<1% malignancy): Clinical and ultrasound surveillance
- **III. Atypia of undetermined significance (AUS)** (10-30%): Repeat FNA or molecular testing
- **IV. Follicular neoplasm** (25-40%): Consider molecular testing or diagnostic lobectomy
- **V. Suspicious for malignancy** (50-75%): Thyroidectomy
- **VI. Malignant** (97-99%): Thyroidectomy

**Molecular testing**:
- Gene expression classifiers (Afirma, ThyroSeq)
- Help stratify indeterminate nodules (Bethesda III, IV)
- High negative predictive value (rule out malignancy)

### Management

**Benign nodules**:
- Clinical and ultrasound surveillance
- Repeat ultrasound at 12-24 months, then less frequently if stable
- Repeat FNA if growth >20% in two dimensions or suspicious features develop
- Levothyroxine suppression not routinely recommended

**Nodules with indeterminate cytology**:
- Molecular testing
- Diagnostic lobectomy if molecular testing unavailable or high-risk features
- Close surveillance if low risk and molecular testing negative

**Surgery indications**:
- Malignant or suspicious cytology
- Compressive symptoms
- Substernal extension
- Patient preference (anxiety, cosmetic)

## Thyroid Cancer

### Types and Epidemiology

**Differentiated thyroid cancer** (95%):
- **Papillary thyroid cancer (PTC)**: 80-85%
  - Most common type
  - Excellent prognosis (>95% 10-year survival)
  - Spreads via lymphatics
  - BRAF V600E mutation common

- **Follicular thyroid cancer (FTC)**: 10-15%
  - Hematogenous spread (lung, bone)
  - Good prognosis (>90% 10-year survival)
  - RAS mutations common

**Medullary thyroid cancer (MTC)**: 3-5%
- Arises from parafollicular C cells
- Secretes calcitonin
- Sporadic (75%) or familial (25%, MEN2)
- Moderate prognosis (80% 10-year survival)
- RET proto-oncogene mutations

**Anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC)**: 1-2%
- Highly aggressive, undifferentiated
- Poor prognosis (median survival 3-6 months)
- Often presents with large, rapidly growing neck mass
- Typically not amenable to RAI

### Clinical Presentation

**Symptoms**:
- Often asymptomatic thyroid nodule
- Neck mass or goiter
- Cervical lymphadenopathy
- Hoarseness (recurrent laryngeal nerve invasion)
- Dysphagia or dyspnea (esophageal or tracheal compression)
- Hemoptysis (advanced)

**Physical examination**:
- Hard, fixed nodule
- Cervical lymphadenopathy
- Vocal cord paralysis

### Staging and Risk Stratification

**TNM staging** (AJCC 8th edition):
- Modified for differentiated thyroid cancer
- Age is critical factor (<55 vs ≥55 years)
- Patients <55 years: Only stages I and II (excellent prognosis)

**ATA risk stratification** (recurrence risk):
- **Low risk**:
  - Intrathyroidal papillary or follicular cancer
  - No vascular invasion, no metastases
  - Tumor completely resected
  - No aggressive histology
  - Recurrence risk <5%

- **Intermediate risk**:
  - Microscopic extrathyroidal extension
  - Vascular invasion
  - Aggressive histology (tall cell, columnar)
  - RAI uptake outside thyroid bed
  - Recurrence risk 5-20%

- **High risk**:
  - Macroscopic extrathyroidal extension
  - Incomplete resection
  - Distant metastases
  - Postoperative thyroglobulin suggesting metastases
  - Recurrence risk 20-50%

### Treatment

**Surgery**:
- **Total thyroidectomy**: Preferred for tumors >4 cm, bilateral disease, extrathyroidal extension, or lymph node metastases
- **Lobectomy**: Acceptable for low-risk tumors <4 cm, unifocal, intrathyroidal, no metastases
- **Neck dissection**: Therapeutic for clinically evident lymph nodes; prophylactic central neck dissection controversial

**Radioactive iodine (RAI) ablation**:
- **Indications**:
  - High-risk patients (distant metastases, gross extrathyroidal extension)
  - Intermediate-risk patients (selective use)
  - Low-risk patients: Generally not recommended

- **Preparation**:
  - TSH stimulation (thyroid hormone withdrawal or recombinant TSH)
  - Low-iodine diet for 1-2 weeks

- **Dose**: 30-150 mCi depending on risk and extent of disease

- **Post-therapy whole-body scan**: Identify metastatic disease

**TSH suppression**:
- Levothyroxine to suppress TSH (reduces recurrence risk)
- **Target TSH**:
  - High risk: <0.1 mIU/L
  - Intermediate risk: 0.1-0.5 mIU/L
  - Low risk: 0.5-2.0 mIU/L
  - After 5-10 years disease-free: Relax to normal range

**Surveillance**:
- Physical exam and neck ultrasound every 6-12 months
- Serum thyroglobulin (tumor marker):
  - Suppressed Tg (<0.2 ng/mL on TSH suppression)
  - Stimulated Tg (after TSH stimulation or recombinant TSH)
  - Rising Tg suggests recurrence
- Thyroglobulin antibodies (interfere with Tg measurement)

**Advanced/metastatic disease**:
- RAI-refractory disease: Consider kinase inhibitors
  - Sorafenib, lenvatinib (for differentiated thyroid cancer)
  - Cabozantinib, vandetanib (for medullary thyroid cancer)
- External beam radiation for unresectable disease
- Chemotherapy (limited role, mainly for anaplastic cancer)

**Medullary thyroid cancer**:
- Total thyroidectomy with central neck dissection
- RAI not effective
- Monitor calcitonin and CEA levels
- Genetic testing for RET mutations (screen family members if positive)

## Prognosis

### Hypothyroidism
- Excellent prognosis with levothyroxine replacement
- Most patients achieve normal quality of life
- Lifelong monitoring required

### Hyperthyroidism
- Good prognosis with treatment
- Graves' disease: 30-50% remission with ATDs
- Most require definitive therapy (RAI or surgery)
- Ophthalmopathy may persist or worsen after RAI

### Thyroid Cancer
- **Papillary and follicular**: Excellent prognosis
  - 10-year survival: >95% (low risk), 75-85% (high risk)
  - Recurrence: 10-30%, usually within 10 years

- **Medullary**: Moderate prognosis
  - 10-year survival: 75-85%
  - Depends on stage at diagnosis

- **Anaplastic**: Very poor prognosis
  - Median survival: 3-6 months
  - <5% 5-year survival

## Key Points

- TSH is the best screening test for thyroid dysfunction; suppressed TSH indicates hyperthyroidism, elevated TSH indicates primary hypothyroidism
- Hypothyroidism is most commonly caused by Hashimoto's thyroiditis in iodine-sufficient areas; treat with levothyroxine targeting TSH 0.5-2.5 mIU/L
- Graves' disease is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism; treatment options include antithyroid drugs, radioactive iodine, and thyroidectomy
- Thyroid storm and myxedema coma are endocrine emergencies requiring ICU management and aggressive treatment
- Most thyroid nodules are benign; use TSH, ultrasound, and FNA with Bethesda classification to guide management
- Differentiated thyroid cancers (papillary, follicular) have excellent prognosis; treatment includes surgery, selective RAI, and TSH suppression
- Subclinical thyroid disease is common; treatment decisions should be individualized based on symptoms, TSH level, and patient factors
