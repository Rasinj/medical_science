# HIV/AIDS

## Overview

Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is a chronic viral disease that progressively destroys the immune system, particularly CD4+ T lymphocytes, leading to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Since its recognition in 1981, HIV has caused over 40 million deaths worldwide. With modern antiretroviral therapy (ART), HIV has transformed from a uniformly fatal disease to a manageable chronic condition with near-normal life expectancy.

### Definitions

**HIV infection**: Confirmed by laboratory testing (antibody, antigen, nucleic acid test)

**AIDS**: HIV infection with either:
- CD4+ T cell count <200 cells/μL OR
- CD4+ percentage <14% OR
- AIDS-defining illness (regardless of CD4 count)

**AIDS-defining illnesses**: Opportunistic infections or malignancies indicating severe immunodeficiency (see Complications section)

### Epidemiology

**Global burden**:
- 39 million people living with HIV (2022)
- 1.3 million new infections annually
- 630,000 AIDS-related deaths annually (decreased from 2 million in 2004)
- Sub-Saharan Africa: 70% of global HIV burden

**United States**:
- 1.2 million people living with HIV
- 35,000-40,000 new infections annually
- Most affected: Men who have sex with men (MSM), Black/African American communities, Southern states

**Transmission risk per exposure**:
- Blood transfusion: 90-95%
- Needle-sharing injection drug use: 0.63%
- Receptive anal intercourse: 1.38%
- Insertive anal intercourse: 0.11%
- Receptive vaginal intercourse: 0.08%
- Insertive vaginal intercourse: 0.04%
- Receptive oral sex: Low risk (0.01-0.04%)
- Mother-to-child: 25-30% (without intervention), <1% (with ART)
- Needlestick (healthcare): 0.23%

### Virology

**Structure**:
- Enveloped retrovirus (family Retroviridae, genus Lentivirus)
- Two copies of single-stranded RNA genome
- Reverse transcriptase: Converts RNA to DNA
- Key proteins:
  - **Envelope glycoproteins**: gp120 (binds CD4), gp41 (fusion)
  - **Core proteins**: p24 (capsid antigen)
  - **Enzymes**: Reverse transcriptase, integrase, protease

**HIV types**:
- **HIV-1**: Global pandemic, more virulent
  - Groups: M (main, 95%), O, N, P
  - Group M subtypes (clades): A, B, C, D, etc. (clade B predominant in U.S.)
- **HIV-2**: West Africa, less transmissible, slower progression

**Genetic variability**:
- High mutation rate (reverse transcriptase lacks proofreading)
- Rapid evolution enables immune escape and drug resistance
- Quasi-species: Multiple genetic variants within individual

## Pathophysiology

### Transmission

**Routes**:
- **Sexual contact**: Most common worldwide (MSM, heterosexual)
- **Blood exposure**: Injection drug use (needle-sharing), occupational exposure, transfusion (rare in screened blood supply)
- **Vertical transmission**: Mother-to-child (in utero, peripartum, breastfeeding)

**Factors increasing transmission**:
- High viral load in source (acute infection, advanced AIDS)
- Genital ulcer disease (HSV, syphilis)
- Other STIs (gonorrhea, chlamydia)
- Receptive partner in intercourse
- Lack of male circumcision
- Mucosal trauma

**Factors decreasing transmission**:
- Undetectable viral load (U=U: undetectable equals untransmittable)
- Antiretroviral therapy
- Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP)
- Post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP)
- Male circumcision (50-60% reduction)
- Condom use (80% reduction)

### Viral Life Cycle

1. **Attachment and entry**:
   - gp120 binds CD4 receptor on T cells, macrophages, dendritic cells
   - Coreceptor binding: CCR5 (early infection, "R5-tropic") or CXCR4 (late infection, "X4-tropic")
   - gp41-mediated fusion with cell membrane

2. **Reverse transcription**:
   - Viral RNA reverse transcribed to double-stranded DNA (reverse transcriptase)
   - Error-prone process generates mutations

3. **Integration**:
   - Viral DNA transported to nucleus
   - Integrase inserts viral DNA into host chromosome
   - Provirus established (permanent)

4. **Transcription and translation**:
   - Host transcription machinery produces viral RNA and proteins
   - Polyproteins cleaved by viral protease

5. **Assembly and budding**:
   - New virions assemble and bud from cell membrane
   - Maturation requires protease cleavage
   - Cell may die or continue producing virus

### Immunopathogenesis

**CD4+ T cell depletion**:
- Direct cytopathic effect (cell lysis during viral replication)
- Syncytia formation (cell-cell fusion)
- Apoptosis of infected and bystander cells
- Immune activation and exhaustion
- Preferential infection of activated, memory CD4+ T cells

**Chronic immune activation**:
- Persistent inflammation despite ART
- Elevated cytokines (IL-6, TNF-α, D-dimer)
- Microbial translocation (gut barrier disruption)
- Contributes to non-AIDS comorbidities (cardiovascular disease, cancer, neurocognitive decline)

**Reservoir establishment**:
- Latently infected resting CD4+ T cells
- Integrated provirus in long-lived memory T cells
- Persists despite ART (major barrier to cure)
- Viral rebound if ART stopped

**Immune dysfunction**:
- Quantitative: Decreased CD4+ T cell count
- Qualitative: Impaired T cell function, loss of CD4+ memory responses
- B cell dysfunction: Polyclonal activation, impaired antibody responses
- Dysregulated cytokine production
- Loss of mucosal immunity (especially gut-associated lymphoid tissue)

### Natural History

**Acute HIV infection** (2-4 weeks after exposure):
- High viral load (millions of copies/mL)
- Rapid CD4+ decline (transient)
- Dissemination to lymphoid tissues
- Establishment of viral reservoir
- Symptomatic in 40-90% (acute retroviral syndrome)
- Highly infectious (high viral load)

**Chronic HIV infection** (asymptomatic phase):
- Duration: 8-10 years average (wide variability)
- Viral set point established (determines disease progression rate)
- Gradual CD4+ decline (50-100 cells/μL per year)
- Asymptomatic or mild symptoms
- Generalized lymphadenopathy common

**AIDS** (CD4 <200 or AIDS-defining illness):
- Opportunistic infections and malignancies
- Wasting syndrome
- Without ART: Median survival 1-2 years

**Elite controllers**:
- <1% of HIV-infected individuals
- Maintain undetectable viral load without ART
- Vigorous HIV-specific CD8+ T cell responses
- Protective HLA alleles (B*27, B*57)

## Clinical Presentation

### Acute HIV Infection (Acute Retroviral Syndrome)

**Timing**: 2-4 weeks after exposure (can be 1-6 weeks)

**Symptoms** (40-90% of patients):
- **Fever** (96%): High-grade, prolonged

## Diagnosis

### Screening Recommendations

**Universal screening**:
- All persons aged 13-64 years at least once (CDC)
- Pregnant women (all pregnancies)
- Opt-out approach (unless patient declines)

**Repeat screening** (at least annually):
- Sexually active MSM (every 3-6 months if high risk)
- Persons with multiple sexual partners
- Sex workers
- Injection drug users
- Partners of HIV-positive persons
- Persons with STIs or requesting STI testing
- Persons with TB or hepatitis B/C

**Indications for testing**:
- Signs/symptoms suggestive of HIV or AIDS
- Potential exposure (occupational, sexual, perinatal)
- Pregnancy
- Before starting PrEP

### Diagnostic Tests

**Recommended algorithm** (CDC/APHL 2014):

**Step 1: Combination HIV-1/HIV-2 antigen/antibody immunoassay (4th generation)**:
- Detects HIV-1 p24 antigen and HIV-1/HIV-2 antibodies
- Positive: 2-6 weeks after infection (earlier than antibody-only tests)
- Sensitivity: >99%, Specificity: >99%
- If reactive → proceed to step 2

**Step 2: HIV-1/HIV-2 antibody differentiation assay**:
- Distinguishes HIV-1 from HIV-2
- If positive for HIV-1 → HIV-1 infection confirmed
- If positive for HIV-2 → HIV-2 infection confirmed (rare in U.S.)
- If negative or indeterminate → proceed to step 3

**Step 3: HIV-1 RNA (viral load)**:
- Confirms acute HIV infection (antibodies not yet developed)
- If detectable → acute HIV-1 infection
- If undetectable → false positive initial test (HIV negative)

**Older tests** (not recommended for diagnosis):
- ELISA followed by Western blot (3rd generation)
- Slower, less sensitive in acute infection

**Rapid HIV tests**:
- Point-of-care antibody tests (fingerstick, oral swab)
- Results: 20 minutes
- Reactive results require confirmatory testing
- Useful for PEP evaluation, labor and delivery, outreach settings

**Window period**:
- Time from infection to test positivity
- 4th generation: 18-45 days
- 3rd generation antibody only: 23-90 days
- NAT (HIV RNA): 10-33 days

### Baseline Evaluation After HIV Diagnosis

**Laboratory tests**:
- **CD4+ T cell count**: Assess immune status, need for prophylaxis
- **HIV RNA (viral load)**: Baseline, monitor ART response
- **HIV genotype (resistance testing)**: Before starting ART (transmitted resistance)
- **HLA-B*5701**: Screen before abacavir (hypersensitivity risk)
- **Tropism testing**: If considering CCR5 antagonist
- **Complete blood count, CMP**: Baseline organ function
- **Hepatitis B serology**: HBsAg, anti-HBs, anti-HBc (co-infection common, affects ART choice)
- **Hepatitis C antibody**: Screen for co-infection
- **Lipid panel, fasting glucose**: Cardiovascular risk, baseline
- **Urinalysis**: Screen for proteinuria (HIVAN, ART toxicity)
- **Pregnancy test**: Women of childbearing potential

**Clinical assessment**:
- Complete history and physical
- Sexual history, substance use
- Screen for opportunistic infections
- Mental health, social support assessment

## Treatment

### Antiretroviral Therapy (ART)

**Goals of ART**:
- Suppress HIV RNA to undetectable levels (<20-50 copies/mL)
- Restore and preserve immune function (increase CD4+ count)
- Prevent disease progression
- Reduce HIV transmission (U=U: undetectable equals untransmittable)
- Improve quality of life and life expectancy

**Indications for ART**:
- **All persons with HIV** (regardless of CD4 count)
- Start as soon as possible after diagnosis (same-day initiation preferred)
- Benefits: Individual health, prevention of transmission

**Components of ART**:
- Combination therapy: ≥3 drugs from ≥2 classes
- Prevents resistance
- Maximizes viral suppression

**Antiretroviral drug classes**:

1. **Nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs)**:

   - **Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF)**: Alternative, requires monitoring renal/bone
   - **Emtricitabine (FTC)**: Always combined with tenofovir
   - **Abacavir (ABC)**: Screen HLA-B*5701 (hypersensitivity risk if positive)
   - **Lamivudine (3TC)**: Alternative to FTC
   - **Zidovudine (AZT)**: Older, more toxic (anemia)

2. **Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs)**:
   - Non-competitive inhibitors of reverse transcriptase
   - **Efavirenz (EFV)**: Older, CNS side effects (nightmares, dizziness)

### Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome (IRIS)

**Definition**: Paradoxical worsening of infection or inflammatory condition after starting ART due to restoration of immune responses

**Risk factors**:
- Low baseline CD4 (<50)
- High viral load
- Rapid CD4 recovery
- Early ART initiation after OI diagnosis

**Timing**: 2 weeks to 6 months after ART initiation (median 4-8 weeks)

## Prognosis

**Without treatment**:
- Median time to AIDS: 8-10 years
- Median survival after AIDS diagnosis: 1-2 years
- Mortality: Nearly 100%

**With ART**:
- Near-normal life expectancy if started early (CD4 >500)
- Life expectancy: 20-50 years from diagnosis (depends on age at diagnosis, CD4 nadir, ART adherence)
- Undetectable viral load: No risk of sexual transmission (U=U)
- Leading causes of death: Non-AIDS comorbidities (cardiovascular disease, cancer, liver disease)

**Prognostic factors**:
- **CD4 nadir**: Lower nadir associated with worse outcomes (even with ART)
- **Time to ART initiation**: Earlier is better
- **Viral suppression**: Sustained undetectable viral load improves outcomes
- **Adherence**: Critical for long-term success
- **Comorbidities**: HBV/HCV, substance use, cardiovascular risk factors

**Elite controllers**:
- <1% maintain undetectable viral load without ART
- Slower CD4 decline
- Still recommended to start ART (long-term immune activation)

## Key Points

- HIV is a chronic infection that requires lifelong antiretroviral therapy (ART) to suppress viral replication and restore immune function
- All persons with HIV should start ART immediately after diagnosis (regardless of CD4 count) to improve individual outcomes and prevent transmission
- Modern ART regimens (INSTI-based) achieve viral suppression (undetectable viral load <50 copies/mL) in >95% of adherent patients within 6 months
- Undetectable viral load eliminates risk of sexual transmission (U=U: undetectable equals untransmittable)
- Opportunistic infection prophylaxis is indicated based on CD4 count: PCP/toxoplasmosis prophylaxis at CD4 <200, MAC prophylaxis at CD4 <50
- Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) with daily oral TDF/FTC or injectable cabotegravir reduces HIV acquisition risk by >90% in adherent individuals
- Post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) should be initiated within 72 hours of high-risk exposure and continued for 28 days
- CD4 count and HIV viral load are the most important monitoring parameters: CD4 assesses immune status and OI risk, viral load monitors ART efficacy
- Acute HIV infection presents with nonspecific viral syndrome (fever, rash, lymphadenopathy) 2-4 weeks after exposure and is highly infectious due to very high viral load
- Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) can occur 2 weeks to 6 months after ART initiation and is managed by continuing ART and treating underlying infections, with corticosteroids for severe cases
