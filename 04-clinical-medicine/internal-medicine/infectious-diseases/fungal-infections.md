# Fungal Infections

## Overview

Invasive fungal infections represent life-threatening diseases primarily affecting immunocompromised patients, though some endemic fungi can infect immunocompetent hosts. The incidence has increased dramatically due to advances in cancer chemotherapy, solid organ and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, and the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Major invasive fungal pathogens include Aspergillus, Candida, Cryptococcus, Pneumocystis, and endemic mycoses (Histoplasma, Coccidioides, Blastomyces).

### Classification

**By morphology**:
- **Yeasts**: Single cells, reproduce by budding (Candida, Cryptococcus)
- **Molds**: Multicellular, filamentous hyphae (Aspergillus, Mucorales)
- **Dimorphic fungi**: Mold in environment, yeast in tissue (Histoplasma, Coccidioides, Blastomyces)

**By infection pattern**:
- **Opportunistic**: Aspergillus, Candida, Cryptococcus, Mucorales, Pneumocystis (immunocompromised hosts)
- **Endemic**: Histoplasma, Coccidioides, Blastomyces (geographic distribution, can infect immunocompetent)
- **Superficial/cutaneous**: Dermatophytes (outside scope of this chapter)

### Risk Factors for Invasive Fungal Infections

**Immunosuppression**:
- Neutropenia (<500 cells/μL, especially prolonged >10 days)
- Hematologic malignancies (acute leukemia, lymphoma)
- Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT)
- Solid organ transplantation (SOT)
- HIV/AIDS (CD4 <100 cells/μL)
- Corticosteroid therapy (prednisone >20 mg/day × 3 weeks)
- Biologic immunosuppressants (TNF-α inhibitors)

**Other risk factors**:
- ICU admission, mechanical ventilation
- Broad-spectrum antibiotics
- Central venous catheters
- Total parenteral nutrition
- Abdominal surgery
- Burns
- Diabetes mellitus
- Chronic kidney disease

### Epidemiology

**Global burden**:
- Invasive candidiasis: Most common invasive fungal infection (75,000 cases/year worldwide)
- Invasive aspergillosis: 200,000-300,000 cases/year, mortality 30-95%
- Cryptococcosis: 220,000 cases/year (primarily in HIV)
- Pneumocystis pneumonia: Leading opportunistic infection in AIDS (before ART era)

## Invasive Aspergillosis

### Overview

Invasive aspergillosis is a life-threatening infection primarily affecting immunocompromised patients, particularly those with prolonged neutropenia or defective phagocyte function. Aspergillus fumigatus is the most common species.

### Microbiology and Epidemiology

**Organism**:
- Aspergillus species: Filamentous molds
- A. fumigatus (90%), A. flavus, A. niger, A. terreus (amphotericin-resistant)
- Ubiquitous in environment (soil, decaying vegetation, air)
- Spores (conidia) aerosolized and inhaled

**Epidemiology**:
- Incidence: 5-20% in allogeneic HSCT, 5-10% in acute leukemia
- Nosocomial outbreaks: Construction, contaminated water
- Mortality: 30-90% (depends on host, site, treatment timing)

### Pathophysiology

**Transmission**:
- Inhalation of airborne spores (200-300/day in normal environment)
- Spore size: 2-3 μm (reach alveoli)

**Pathogenesis**:
- Normal hosts: Innate immunity clears spores (alveolar macrophages, neutrophils)
- Immunocompromised: Spores germinate → hyphae invade tissue
- Angioinvasion: Hyphae invade blood vessels → thrombosis, infarction, dissemination
- Tissue necrosis, hemorrhage

**Risk factors**:
- Prolonged neutropenia (most important)
- Glucocorticoids (impair phagocyte function)
- Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD)
- Advanced HIV (CD4 <50, less common than in other immunocompromised)
- Chronic granulomatous disease (genetic phagocyte defect)
- Lung disease (COPD, asthma)

### Clinical Presentation

**Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA)** (most common):
- Fever refractory to broad-spectrum antibiotics
- Cough (nonproductive or hemoptysis)
- Pleuritic chest pain (pleural involvement)
- Dyspnea
- Physical exam: Often unremarkable, crackles rare
- Cavitation, pneumothorax (late findings)

**Tracheobronchial aspergillosis**:
- Seen in lung transplant recipients
- Airway obstruction, ulcers, pseudomembranes
- Bronchoscopy diagnostic

**Disseminated aspergillosis**:
- Hematogenous spread from lungs
- CNS (brain abscesses, meningitis): Headache, focal deficits, seizures
- Skin: Papules, nodules (biopsy shows hyphae)
- Liver, spleen: Abscesses
- Heart: Endocarditis (rare, often prosthetic valve)

**Chronic pulmonary aspergillosis**:
- Occurs in structural lung disease (cavities, fibrocystic disease)
- Aspergilloma (fungal ball in cavity)
- Chronic cavitary aspergillosis
- Hemoptysis (can be life-threatening)

**Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA)**:
- Hypersensitivity reaction (not invasive)
- Asthma, cystic fibrosis
- Wheezing, mucus plugs, eosinophilia, elevated IgE

### Diagnosis

**Imaging**:

*Chest CT (preferred over chest X-ray)*:
- **Nodules**: Single or multiple
- **Halo sign** (early): Ground-glass opacity surrounding nodule (hemorrhage)
  - Highly suggestive in neutropenic patients
- **Air crescent sign** (late): Crescent of air around necrotic tissue
  - Indicates healing, neutrophil recovery
- **Cavitation**: Occurs as neutrophils recover
- **Wedge-shaped infarcts**: Angioinvasion
- Chest X-ray: Less sensitive, may be normal

**Microbiologic diagnosis**:

*Culture*:
- Sputum culture: Low sensitivity (20-30%), may represent colonization
- Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL): Sensitivity 50%
- Tissue biopsy: Gold standard (>90% sensitivity)
  - Demonstrates tissue invasion by septate hyphae with acute-angle branching
- Blood cultures: Always negative (not angioinvasive enough)

*Galactomannan assay*:
- Detects Aspergillus cell wall antigen (polysaccharide)
- Serum: Sensitivity 70%, specificity 90% (two positive tests)
- BAL: Higher sensitivity (80-90%)
- False positives: Piperacillin-tazobactam, other molds (Penicillium)
- False negatives: Mold-active prophylaxis (voriconazole, posaconazole)
- Optical density index (ODI) ≥0.5 positive

*Beta-D-glucan*:
- Pan-fungal cell wall antigen (Aspergillus, Candida, Pneumocystis)
- Not specific for Aspergillus
- ≥80 pg/mL positive

*Aspergillus PCR*:
- Detects Aspergillus DNA in blood, BAL
- Not FDA-approved, availability varies
- Sensitivity 80-90% in serum

**Histopathology**:
- Tissue biopsy: Septate hyphae, acute-angle branching (45°)
- Angioinvasion, tissue necrosis
- GMS or PAS stain

**Diagnostic criteria (EORTC/MSG)**:
- **Proven**: Tissue invasion by hyphae
- **Probable**: Host factor + clinical + mycologic evidence
- **Possible**: Host factor + clinical evidence (no mycologic)

### Treatment

**First-line therapy**:
- **Voriconazole**: 6 mg/kg IV every 12 hours × 2 doses, then 4 mg/kg every 12 hours
  - Oral: 200-300 mg PO every 12 hours (after loading)
  - Superior to amphotericin B (NEJM 2002 trial)
  - Monitor levels (target trough 1-5.5 μg/mL)
  - Side effects: Visual disturbances, hepatotoxicity, QT prolongation
  - Drug interactions: CYP450 inhibitor

**Alternative agents**:
- **Isavuconazole**: 372 mg IV/PO every 8 hours × 6 doses, then 372 mg daily
  - Non-inferior to voriconazole
  - Fewer side effects, no visual disturbances
  - Better QT profile
- **Liposomal amphotericin B**: 3-5 mg/kg IV daily
  - If azole-intolerant or resistant (A. terreus)
  - Nephrotoxic, infusion reactions
- **Posaconazole**: 300 mg IV/PO BID day 1, then 300 mg daily
  - Salvage therapy
- **Echinocandins**: Not first-line monotherapy (fungistatic against Aspergillus)
  - Combination with voriconazole/amphotericin in severe cases

**Duration**:
- Minimum 6-12 weeks
- Continue until immunosuppression resolved and lesions resolved/stable

**Adjunctive measures**:
- Reversal of immunosuppression (if possible):
  - Neutrophil recovery
  - Reduce corticosteroids
  - G-CSF, GM-CSF (stimulate neutrophils)
- Surgical resection: Localized disease, hemoptysis, near great vessels
- Treat underlying condition

**Refractory disease**:
- Combination therapy: Voriconazole + echinocandin (caspofungin)
- Alternative azoles: Posaconazole, isavuconazole
- Amphotericin formulations

### Prevention

**Primary prophylaxis** (high-risk patients):
- **Posaconazole**: 300 mg PO daily
  - Acute myeloid leukemia/MDS during chemotherapy
  - GVHD on immunosuppression
- **Voriconazole** or **itraconazole**: Alternatives
- Lung transplant recipients: Voriconazole, itraconazole, or inhaled amphotericin

**Environmental controls**:
- HEPA filtration (positive pressure rooms)
- Avoid construction areas
- Masks during high-risk periods

### Prognosis

- Mortality: 30-90% (depends on host, early treatment)
- Poor prognostic factors:
  - Persistent neutropenia
  - Disseminated disease
  - CNS involvement
  - Delayed treatment
  - Breakthrough infection on prophylaxis

## Invasive Candidiasis

### Overview

Invasive candidiasis encompasses candidemia (bloodstream infection) and deep-seated candidiasis (intra-abdominal, cardiac, CNS). Candida is the most common cause of healthcare-associated bloodstream infections in the United States.

### Microbiology and Epidemiology

**Organism**:
- Candida species: Yeasts (budding, pseudohyphae)
- **C. albicans**: Most common (40-50%)
- **C. glabrata**: 15-30% (intrinsically less susceptible to fluconazole)
- **C. parapsilosis**: 10-20% (catheter-associated, neonates)
- **C. tropicalis**: 5-10% (neutropenic patients)
- **C. krusei**: <5% (intrinsically resistant to fluconazole)
- **C. auris**: Emerging multidrug-resistant pathogen

**Epidemiology**:
- Incidence: 8-10 cases per 100,000 population
- Fourth most common bloodstream infection in hospitals
- Mortality: 40-60% (candidemia)

### Pathophysiology

**Source**:
- Endogenous: GI tract, skin colonization (most common)
- Exogenous: Central venous catheters, contaminated IV solutions

**Pathogenesis**:
- Disruption of mucosal/skin barriers (surgery, catheters)
- Entry into bloodstream
- Adherence to endothelium, medical devices
- Biofilm formation (catheter)
- Dissemination to organs

**Risk factors**:
- Central venous catheters (most important for non-neutropenic)
- Broad-spectrum antibiotics (alter gut flora)
- ICU admission
- Abdominal surgery (especially recurrent)
- Total parenteral nutrition
- Hemodialysis
- Neutropenia
- Solid organ transplantation
- Corticosteroids
- Candida colonization (multiple sites)

### Clinical Presentation

**Candidemia**:

- Acute disseminated candidiasis: Skin lesions, retinal lesions, muscle abscesses

**Chronic disseminated candidiasis (hepatosplenic)**:
- Prolonged fever in neutropenic patients (during neutrophil recovery)
- Abdominal pain
- Elevated alkaline phosphatase
- CT/MRI: Multiple small abscesses (liver, spleen, kidneys) "bull's eye" lesions

**Endocarditis**:
- Large vegetations (>10 mm)
- Embolic phenomena, heart failure
- Often requires valve replacement

**CNS candidiasis**:
- Meningitis (more common in neonates)
- Brain abscesses, microabscesses
- Usually hematogenous spread

**Intra-abdominal candidiasis**:
- Post-surgical, perforated viscus
- Peritonitis, abscesses
- Often polymicrobial

**Osteoarticular**:

- Hematogenous or direct inoculation (IVDU)

**Urinary tract**:
- Candiduria: Often asymptomatic colonization (catheter)
- Ascending infection: Pyelonephritis, perinephric abscess
- Fungal balls (renal pelvis, bladder)

### Diagnosis

**Blood cultures**:
- Positive in candidemia (sensitivity 50-70%)
- Single positive culture significant (not contaminant)
- Time to positivity: 1-3 days
- Speciation and susceptibility testing essential
- Repeat daily until clearance documented

**Beta-D-glucan**:
- Elevated in invasive candidiasis (≥80 pg/mL)
- Sensitivity 70-80%, specificity 80%
- Not specific for Candida (also Aspergillus, Pneumocystis)
- Useful for screening high-risk patients

**T2Candida panel**:
- Rapid PCR-based assay (detects 5 Candida species in blood)
- Results in 3-5 hours
- Higher sensitivity than blood culture (90% vs. 50%)
- Expensive, limited availability

**Candida mannan and anti-mannan antibodies**:
- Combined assay (antigen + antibody)
- Sensitivity 83%, specificity 86%
- Not widely available

**Imaging**:
- Echocardiography: Evaluate for endocarditis (especially if prosthetic valve, persistent candidemia)
- CT/MRI abdomen: Hepatosplenic candidiasis, intra-abdominal abscesses
- Fundoscopic exam: Candida endophthalmitis (10% of candidemia)

**Tissue culture and histopathology**:
- Gold standard for deep-seated candidiasis
- Biopsy shows budding yeasts, pseudohyphae

### Treatment

**Initial therapy** (before susceptibility results):

*Non-neutropenic patients*:
- **Echinocandins** (first-line):
  - **Caspofungin**: 70 mg IV loading, then 50 mg IV daily
  - **Micafungin**: 100 mg IV daily
  - **Anidulafungin**: 200 mg IV loading, then 100 mg IV daily
  - Fungicidal, excellent safety profile
  - Preferred for critically ill, prior azole exposure

*Azole therapy*:
- **Fluconazole**: 800 mg IV/PO loading, then 400 mg daily
  - If hemodynamically stable, no prior azole, low risk of C. glabrata/krusei
  - Not first-line for critically ill

*Amphotericin B*:
- Liposomal amphotericin B 3-5 mg/kg IV daily
- If azole and echinocandin resistance/intolerance

**Tailored therapy** (based on species and susceptibilities):
- **C. albicans**: Fluconazole 400-800 mg daily (step-down after clinical improvement)
- **C. glabrata**: Echinocandin preferred (fluconazole MIC often elevated)
- **C. parapsilosis**: Fluconazole preferred (echinocandin MIC higher)
- **C. krusei**: Echinocandin or voriconazole (resistant to fluconazole)
- **C. auris**: Echinocandin (often multidrug-resistant)

**Source control**:
- **Remove central venous catheter**: Critical (remove within 24-48 hours)
- Drain abscesses
- Remove infected prosthetic devices

**Duration**:
- Candidemia without metastatic complications: 14 days after blood culture clearance and symptom resolution
- Endocarditis: ≥6 weeks (after valve replacement)
- CNS: Weeks to months
- Osteoarticular: 6-12 months
- Chronic disseminated: Months (until lesions resolved)

**Ophthalmologic evaluation**:
- Dilated fundoscopy within 1 week of candidemia diagnosis
- Evaluate for endophthalmitis (requires intravitreal antifungals ± vitrectomy)

### Prevention

**Antifungal prophylaxis** (selected high-risk patients):
- Fluconazole 400 mg daily:
  - High-risk ICU (recurrent GI perforation/anastomotic leak)
  - Allogeneic HSCT recipients
  - Liver transplant (selective)
- Echinocandin: If fluconazole resistance prevalent

**Infection control**:
- Hand hygiene
- Early catheter removal
- C. auris: Contact precautions, environmental decontamination

### Prognosis

- Candidemia mortality: 40-60%
- Attributable mortality: 15-25%
- Poor prognostic factors:
  - Delayed therapy (>24-48 hours)
  - Inappropriate initial therapy
  - Persistent candidemia (>3 days)
  - Severe sepsis/shock
  - Non-removal of catheter

## Cryptococcosis

### Overview

Cryptococcosis is a life-threatening fungal infection caused by Cryptococcus neoformans and C. gattii. It primarily affects immunocompromised patients (especially HIV/AIDS) and manifests as meningoencephalitis or pulmonary disease.

### Microbiology and Epidemiology

**Organism**:
- **Cryptococcus neoformans**: Encapsulated yeast
  - Worldwide distribution, associated with pigeon droppings, soil
  - Primarily immunocompromised hosts (HIV, transplant)
- **C. gattii**: Less common
  - Endemic in tropical/subtropical regions, Pacific Northwest
  - Can infect immunocompetent hosts

**Epidemiology**:
- HIV/AIDS: Leading cause of meningitis in sub-Saharan Africa
- United States: 1,000 cases/year (decreasing with ART)
- Most common in CD4 <100 cells/μL (median CD4 <50)

### Pathophysiology

**Transmission**:
- Inhalation of aerosolized spores (basidiospores) from environment
- No person-to-person transmission

**Pathogenesis**:
- Primary infection: Lungs (often asymptomatic or mild in immunocompetent)
- Dissemination: Hematogenous spread to CNS (meningoencephalitis)
- CNS tropism: Organism crosses blood-brain barrier
- Polysaccharide capsule: Major virulence factor (antiphagocytic)
- Cryptococcomas: Gelatinous masses in brain parenchyma

### Clinical Presentation

**Cryptococcal meningoencephalitis** (most common):
- Subacute to chronic onset (2-4 weeks)
- Headache (most common, 80-90%)
- Fever
- Altered mental status, confusion
- Meningismus (less common than bacterial meningitis, 25%)
- Nausea, vomiting (increased ICP)
- Visual changes, diplopia (increased ICP, cranial nerve VI palsy)
- Seizures, focal deficits (cryptococcomas)
- Presentation may be subtle in HIV (blunted inflammatory response)

**Pulmonary cryptococcosis**:
- Asymptomatic nodules (immunocompetent)
- Symptomatic: Cough, dyspnea, fever, pleuritic chest pain
- Severe: ARDS, respiratory failure (immunocompromised)
- Imaging: Nodules, consolidation, cavitation, pleural effusion

**Disseminated cryptococcosis**:
- Skin lesions: Papules, nodules, ulcers (umbilicated, molluscum-like)
- Bone: Osteomyelitis
- Prostate: Reservoir, relapse risk

### Diagnosis

**Serum and CSF cryptococcal antigen (CrAg)**:
- **Cryptococcal antigen lateral flow assay (LFA)**:
  - Highly sensitive (>99%) and specific (>99%)
  - Serum: Screening in HIV with CD4 <100
  - CSF: Diagnostic for meningitis
  - Titer >1:1024 associated with higher fungal burden
- Detection of polysaccharide capsule antigen

**CSF analysis** (lumbar puncture essential):
- Opening pressure: Often markedly elevated (>25 cm H₂O)
  - Elevated ICP: Major cause of morbidity/mortality
- Cell count: Mildly elevated WBCs (20-200, lymphocytic) or normal in HIV
- Protein: Elevated (usually <200 mg/dL)
- Glucose: Low to normal
- India ink stain: Positive in 50-80% (encapsulated yeast)
- Fungal culture: Gold standard (positive in 90%)
- CrAg: Highly sensitive (>95%)

**Imaging**:
- **Brain MRI** (preferred over CT):
  - Cryptococcomas: Ring-enhancing lesions
  - Dilated perivascular spaces (gelatinous pseudocysts)
  - Hydrocephalus
  - Often normal despite meningitis
- **Chest CT**:
  - Nodules, consolidation, cavitation

**Blood cultures**:
- Positive in 50-70% of disseminated cryptococcosis
- Use fungal culture media (lysis-centrifugation)

**Serum CrAg screening**:
- HIV patients with CD4 <100 cells/μL (if not on fluconazole prophylaxis)
- If positive, perform lumbar puncture to rule out meningitis

### Treatment

**Cryptococcal meningoencephalitis** (HIV):

*Induction therapy* (2 weeks):
- **Amphotericin B deoxycholate**: 0.7-1 mg/kg IV daily
  OR
  **Liposomal amphotericin B**: 3-4 mg/kg IV daily (preferred, less toxic)
  PLUS
- **Flucytosine**: 100 mg/kg/day PO divided every 6 hours
  - Synergistic with amphotericin
  - Monitor CBC (bone marrow suppression)
  - Monitor levels (target 50-100 μg/mL)

*Consolidation therapy* (8 weeks):
- **Fluconazole**: 400 mg PO daily
- Begin after completion of induction

*Maintenance therapy* (secondary prophylaxis):
- **Fluconazole**: 200 mg PO daily
- Continue until CD4 >200 for >6 months on ART and CSF sterile

**Non-HIV immunocompromised**:
- Induction: Amphotericin B + flucytosine × 2 weeks (at least)
- Consolidation: Fluconazole 400-800 mg daily × 8 weeks
- Maintenance: Fluconazole 200-400 mg daily × 6-12 months (longer if ongoing immunosuppression)

**Immunocompetent**:
- Mild-moderate: Fluconazole 400-800 mg daily × 6-12 months
- Severe: Amphotericin + flucytosine (induction/consolidation as above)

**Elevated intracranial pressure management** (critical):
- Daily lumbar puncture (or frequent as needed) if opening pressure >25 cm H₂O
- Remove CSF to reduce pressure by 50% or to <20 cm H₂O
- Temporary CSF drainage: Lumbar drain, ventriculoperitoneal shunt
- Acetazolamide, mannitol: Not effective
- Corticosteroids: Contraindicated (worsen outcomes)

**Pulmonary cryptococcosis**:
- Immunocompetent, mild: Observation vs. fluconazole 400 mg daily × 6-12 months
- Immunocompromised or severe: Treat as disseminated disease

**ART initiation timing** (HIV):
- Defer ART for 4-6 weeks after starting antifungal therapy
- Reduces risk of IRIS
- Exception: Very low CD4 (<50), may start earlier with careful monitoring

### Prevention

**Primary prophylaxis**:
- Fluconazole 200 mg daily (if CD4 <100 and unable to start ART)
- Not routinely recommended (prefer ART, screen with serum CrAg)

**Secondary prophylaxis**:
- Fluconazole 200 mg daily after treatment
- Discontinue when CD4 >200 for >6 months on ART

**Screening**:
- Serum CrAg in HIV with CD4 <100 (if not on fluconazole)
- If positive, perform LP and treat preemptively (reduces mortality)

### Prognosis

- Mortality: 10-25% in HIV (higher in resource-limited settings)
- Worse outcomes:
  - Delayed diagnosis
  - High fungal burden (CSF CrAg titer >1:1024)
  - Elevated ICP not managed
  - Altered mental status at presentation
  - Low CSF WBC count in HIV

## Pneumocystis Pneumonia (PCP)

### Overview

Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia is a life-threatening opportunistic infection primarily affecting immunocompromised patients, especially those with HIV/AIDS. It is the most common AIDS-defining illness in patients not receiving prophylaxis or ART.

### Microbiology and Epidemiology

**Organism**:
- Pneumocystis jirovecii (formerly P. carinii)
- Fungus (genetically), but does not respond to antifungals (lacks ergosterol)
- Cannot be cultured on standard media

**Epidemiology**:
- Most common opportunistic infection in AIDS (before ART era)
- Incidence decreased >80% with ART and prophylaxis
- Non-HIV: Increasing recognition (cancer, transplant, inflammatory diseases)

**Transmission**:
- Airborne (person-to-person transmission likely)
- Reactivation vs. new acquisition unclear

### Pathophysiology

**Risk factors**:
- HIV: CD4 <200 cells/μL (90% of PCP), CD4 <100 (highest risk)
- Corticosteroids: Prednisone >20 mg/day × ≥1 month
- Hematologic malignancies (especially ALL)
- Solid organ and HSCT transplantation
- Inflammatory diseases on immunosuppression (GPA, SLE)
- TNF-α inhibitors
- Chemotherapy (especially fludarabine, alemtuzumab)

**Pathogenesis**:
- Inhalation → alveolar proliferation
- Alveolar infiltration by cysts and trophozoites
- Foamy alveolar exudates
- Impaired gas exchange (diffusion defect)
- Inflammatory response causes tissue damage

### Clinical Presentation

**HIV-associated PCP**:
- Subacute onset (weeks)
- Fever (persistent, low-grade initially)
- Nonproductive cough
- Progressive dyspnea (exertional → rest)
- Chest discomfort (substernal)
- Weight loss, night sweats
- Physical exam: Often normal
  - Tachypnea, tachycardia (with exertion)
  - Crackles uncommon
  - Hypoxemia (at rest or with exertion)

**Non-HIV PCP**:
- Acute onset (days)
- More severe hypoxemia
- Rapidly progressive respiratory failure
- Higher mortality than HIV-associated PCP

**Complications**:
- Respiratory failure (requiring intubation)
- Pneumothorax (10-35% in HIV, especially with aerosolized pentamidine prophylaxis)
- Pneumomediastinum
- Extrapulmonary PCP (rare, <3%): Liver, spleen, lymph nodes, bone marrow

### Diagnosis

**Arterial blood gas**:
- Hypoxemia (PaO₂ <70 mmHg on room air)
- Increased A-a gradient
- Respiratory alkalosis

**Laboratory**:
- Elevated LDH (>500 U/L, nonspecific but supportive)
- Beta-D-glucan: Elevated (>100 pg/mL)
  - Sensitivity 90-95%, specificity 85%
  - Not specific for Pneumocystis (also Candida, Aspergillus)

**Chest imaging**:
- **Chest X-ray**:
  - Bilateral diffuse interstitial infiltrates (perihilar, "butterfly" pattern)
  - Ground-glass opacities
  - May be normal early (5-10%)
  - Atypical: Cysts, pneumothorax, nodules, upper lobe infiltrates (with aerosolized pentamidine prophylaxis)
- **Chest CT** (high-resolution):
  - Ground-glass opacities (diffuse or patchy)
  - Cystic lesions
  - More sensitive than CXR

**Microbiologic diagnosis** (required for definitive diagnosis):

*Induced sputum*:
- Sensitivity: 50-90% (depends on technique, institution experience)
- Staining: Giemsa, methenamine silver, immunofluorescence
- Non-invasive, first-line if available

*Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL)*:
- Sensitivity: >90% (gold standard)
- Staining: Giemsa (trophozoites), methenamine silver (cysts), immunofluorescence
- PCR: High sensitivity (>95%) but also detects colonization (lower specificity)

*Lung biopsy*:
- Rarely needed
- Transbronchial or surgical
- Shows foamy intra-alveolar exudates

**Empiric treatment**:
- Often started before microbiologic confirmation in high-risk patients with compatible presentation
- Do not withhold bronchoscopy (organism persists for days despite treatment)

### Treatment

**Moderate to severe PCP** (PaO₂ <70 mmHg or A-a gradient >35 mmHg):

*First-line*:
- **Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX)**:
  - Dose: TMP 15-20 mg/kg/day IV divided every 6-8 hours
  - Duration: 21 days (HIV), 14 days (non-HIV)
  - Switch to oral when improved (same dose)
  - Adverse effects (common): Rash, nausea, hyperkalemia, bone marrow suppression, hepatitis

*Adjunctive corticosteroids* (critical for moderate-severe):
- **Prednisone**: 40 mg PO BID × 5 days, then 40 mg daily × 5 days, then 20 mg daily × 11 days
  - Start within 72 hours of initiating PCP treatment
  - Reduces mortality and respiratory failure (30% reduction)
  - Indication: PaO₂ <70 mmHg or A-a gradient >35 mmHg

**Mild PCP** (PaO₂ >70 mmHg and A-a gradient <35 mmHg):
- **TMP-SMX**: TMP 15 mg/kg/day PO divided every 8 hours × 21 days
- No corticosteroids

**Alternative regimens** (if TMP-SMX intolerant):
- **Pentamidine**: 4 mg/kg IV daily × 21 days
  - Second-line
  - Adverse effects: Hypotension (infuse over 1 hour), hypoglycemia then hyperglycemia, pancreatitis, nephrotoxicity, QT prolongation
- **Clindamycin**: 600-900 mg IV every 6-8 hours (or 300-450 mg PO every 6 hours)
  PLUS
  **Primaquine**: 30 mg (base) PO daily
  - Check G6PD (primaquine causes hemolysis in deficiency)
  - Moderately severe PCP
- **Atovaquone**: 750 mg PO BID with food × 21 days
  - Mild PCP only
  - Take with high-fat meal (increases absorption)

**Monitoring**:
- Clinical worsening in first 3-5 days is common (inflammatory response)
- Improvement expected by 7-10 days
- If no improvement by 5-7 days, consider bronchoscopy (confirm diagnosis, exclude alternative)

**ART initiation** (HIV):
- Start ART during or immediately after PCP treatment
- Improves long-term survival
- IRIS uncommon with PCP

### Prevention

**Primary prophylaxis** (initiate when CD4 <200 or CD4 <14%):
- **TMP-SMX**: 1 double-strength tablet PO daily (preferred)
  - Alternative dosing: 1 DS three times weekly, 1 single-strength daily
  - Also protects against toxoplasmosis, bacterial infections
- **Dapsone**: 100 mg PO daily (if TMP-SMX intolerant)
  - Check G6PD
  - Add pyrimethamine 50 mg weekly for toxoplasmosis prophylaxis
- **Atovaquone**: 1,500 mg PO daily
- **Aerosolized pentamidine**: 300 mg monthly via nebulizer
  - Does not prevent extrapulmonary or upper lobe disease

**Indications**:
- HIV: CD4 <200 cells/μL, oral candidiasis, AIDS-defining illness
- Non-HIV: Prolonged corticosteroids (>20 mg prednisone × 1 month), specific chemotherapy regimens, HSCT, certain immunosuppressive regimens

**Discontinuation** (HIV):
- CD4 >200 for >3 months on ART

**Secondary prophylaxis**:
- Same as primary prophylaxis
- Continue until CD4 >200 for >3 months

### Prognosis

- HIV-associated PCP: Mortality 10-20% (with treatment), 90-100% (without treatment)
- Non-HIV PCP: Mortality 30-60% (higher)
- Poor prognostic factors:
  - Severe hypoxemia (PaO₂ <50 mmHg)
  - Elevated LDH (>500)
  - Mechanical ventilation required
  - Non-HIV host

## Endemic Mycoses

### Overview

Endemic mycoses include histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, and blastomycosis. These are dimorphic fungi with specific geographic distributions that can infect immunocompetent hosts but cause severe disseminated disease in immunocompromised patients.

### Histoplasmosis

**Organism**: Histoplasma capsulatum (dimorphic fungus)

**Geographic distribution**:
- Endemic in Ohio and Mississippi River Valleys (United States)
- Central and South America
- Soil enriched with bird or bat droppings

**Clinical presentation**:
- **Asymptomatic/mild acute pulmonary**: 90% of infections
- **Acute pulmonary histoplasmosis**: Flu-like illness, cough, chest pain, fever
- **Chronic cavitary pulmonary**: COPD patients, upper lobe cavities (mimics TB)
- **Progressive disseminated histoplasmosis** (immunocompromised):
  - Fever, weight loss, hepatosplenomegaly
  - Pancytopenia, elevated LDH
  - Adrenal insufficiency, CNS involvement
  - Mucocutaneous lesions

**Diagnosis**:
- Histoplasma urine and serum antigen (sensitivity 90% in disseminated)
- Antibody: Complement fixation, immunodiffusion (not useful in immunocompromised)
- Culture: Slow (2-6 weeks), gold standard
- Histopathology: Small intracellular yeast in macrophages

**Treatment**:
- Mild-moderate: Itraconazole 200 mg TID × 3 days, then BID × 6-12 weeks
- Severe/disseminated: Liposomal amphotericin B 3 mg/kg IV daily × 2 weeks, then itraconazole × 12 months (HIV) or 6-12 months (non-HIV)
- CNS: Liposomal amphotericin × 4-6 weeks, then itraconazole × 12 months

### Coccidioidomycosis

**Organism**: Coccidioides immitis, C. posadasii (dimorphic)

**Geographic distribution**:
- Southwestern United States (Arizona, California, New Mexico, Texas)
- Mexico, Central and South America

**Clinical presentation**:
- **Asymptomatic**: 60%
- **Acute pulmonary (Valley fever)**: Flu-like, cough, chest pain, fever, rash (erythema nodosum, erythema multiforme)
- **Chronic pulmonary**: Nodules, cavities
- **Disseminated coccidioidomycosis** (immunocompromised, Filipino, African, pregnant):
  - Skin, bones, joints, meninges
  - Coccidioidal meningitis: Basilar meningitis, hydrocephalus

**Diagnosis**:
- Serology: IgM, IgG (complement fixation, immunodiffusion), enzyme immunoassay
- Culture: Highly infectious (biosafety level 3)
- Histopathology: Spherules with endospores

**Treatment**:
- Mild pulmonary: Observation vs. fluconazole 400 mg daily × 3-6 months
- Severe pulmonary: Fluconazole 400-800 mg daily × 12 months
- Disseminated: Fluconazole 400-800 mg daily (lifelong in HIV unless immune reconstitution)
- Meningitis: Fluconazole 400-1200 mg daily (lifelong), intrathecal amphotericin if refractory

### Blastomycosis

**Organism**: Blastomyces dermatitidis (dimorphic)

**Geographic distribution**:
- Southeastern and Midwestern United States
- Great Lakes region
- Mississippi and Ohio River Valleys

**Clinical presentation**:
- **Acute pulmonary**: Flu-like illness, cough, fever, chest pain
- **Chronic pulmonary**: Mimics TB or lung cancer
- **Disseminated**: Skin (most common extrapulmonary, verrucous lesions), bones, genitourinary
- **CNS blastomycosis**: Brain abscesses, meningitis

**Diagnosis**:
- Culture: Gold standard
- Histopathology: Broad-based budding yeast
- Urine antigen: Less sensitive than Histoplasma antigen, cross-reacts
- No reliable serology

**Treatment**:
- Mild-moderate pulmonary: Itraconazole 200 mg TID × 3 days, then BID × 6-12 months
- Severe/disseminated: Liposomal amphotericin B 3-5 mg/kg IV daily × 1-2 weeks, then itraconazole × 12 months
- CNS: Liposomal amphotericin × 4-6 weeks, then azole (voriconazole or fluconazole) × 12 months

## Key Points

- Invasive aspergillosis primarily affects neutropenic patients; voriconazole is first-line therapy, and the halo sign on chest CT is highly suggestive in the appropriate clinical context
- Candidemia requires blood culture, central line removal, and echinocandin therapy for critically ill patients; step-down to fluconazole is appropriate for C. albicans after clinical improvement
- Cryptococcal meningoencephalitis is the leading cause of meningitis in HIV/AIDS (CD4 <100); management of elevated intracranial pressure with serial lumbar punctures is critical to reduce mortality
- Pneumocystis pneumonia presents with subacute dyspnea, nonproductive cough, and bilateral ground-glass opacities; TMP-SMX is first-line treatment, and adjunctive corticosteroids reduce mortality in moderate-severe disease (PaO₂ <70 mmHg)
- TMP-SMX prophylaxis should be initiated when CD4 <200 cells/μL in HIV patients and prevents PCP, toxoplasmosis, and bacterial infections
- Endemic mycoses (histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, blastomycosis) have specific geographic distributions; disseminated disease in immunocompromised patients requires amphotericin B induction followed by azole consolidation
