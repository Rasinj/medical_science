# Viral Infections

## Overview

Viral infections represent a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, affecting virtually every organ system. This chapter focuses on clinically significant systemic viral infections including influenza, hepatitis viruses, cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), and viral hemorrhagic fevers. Understanding viral pathogenesis, clinical presentations, and management strategies is essential for effective patient care.

### Classification

**By nucleic acid**:
- **DNA viruses**: Herpesviruses (HSV, VZV, CMV, EBV), adenovirus, poxviruses, hepatitis B
- **RNA viruses**: Influenza, hepatitis A/C/E, enteroviruses, arboviruses, filoviruses

**By envelope**:
- **Enveloped**: Influenza, herpesviruses, hepatitis B/C, HIV, hemorrhagic fever viruses
- **Non-enveloped**: Adenovirus, hepatitis A/E, norovirus, enteroviruses

**By transmission**:
- **Respiratory**: Influenza, adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus
- **Fecal-oral**: Hepatitis A/E, enteroviruses, norovirus
- **Blood-borne**: Hepatitis B/C, HIV, CMV
- **Vector-borne**: Dengue, yellow fever, Ebola (indirect)
- **Direct contact**: Herpesviruses, poxviruses

### Epidemiology

**Global burden**:
- Viral infections cause ~30% of acute respiratory illnesses
- Hepatitis viruses: 325 million chronic infections worldwide
- Influenza: 3-5 million severe cases, 290,000-650,000 deaths annually
- EBV: 90-95% of adults seropositive by age 40

## Influenza

### Overview

Influenza is an acute respiratory illness caused by influenza viruses (types A, B, C). Influenza A and B cause seasonal epidemics, while influenza A can cause pandemics due to antigenic shift.

### Virology

**Structure**:
- Enveloped, segmented negative-sense RNA virus
- Eight gene segments (reassortment possible)
- Surface proteins:
  - **Hemagglutinin (H)**: Binds sialic acid receptors, mediates viral entry (16 subtypes in influenza A)
  - **Neuraminidase (N)**: Cleaves sialic acid, facilitates viral release (9 subtypes in influenza A)

**Influenza types**:
- **Influenza A**: Most virulent, causes pandemics (animal and human reservoirs)
  - Subtypes: H1N1, H3N2, H5N1 (avian), H7N9 (avian)
- **Influenza B**: Seasonal epidemics only (human reservoir)
  - Lineages: Victoria, Yamagata
- **Influenza C**: Mild disease, sporadic cases

**Antigenic variation**:
- **Antigenic drift**: Minor mutations in H and N genes, seasonal epidemics
- **Antigenic shift**: Reassortment of gene segments, pandemics (influenza A only)

### Pathophysiology

**Transmission**:
- Respiratory droplets (primary)
- Direct contact with contaminated surfaces
- Incubation period: 1-4 days (average 2 days)

**Pathogenesis**:
- Virus binds sialic acid receptors on respiratory epithelium
- Endocytosis and viral replication in epithelial cells
- Cell lysis and release of progeny viruses
- Direct cytopathic effect causes epithelial destruction
- Inflammatory response: Cytokine release (IL-6, TNF-α, IFN-γ)
- Disruption of mucociliary clearance
- Predisposes to secondary bacterial infections

**Host immune response**:
- Innate immunity: Type I interferons, NK cells
- Adaptive immunity: Antibodies against H and N (strain-specific)
- Cellular immunity: CD8+ T cells (cross-reactive, important for recovery)

### Clinical Presentation

**Uncomplicated influenza**:
- **Systemic symptoms** (abrupt onset):
  - High fever (38-40°C), rigors
  - Myalgia, headache
  - Malaise, fatigue
- **Respiratory symptoms**:
  - Dry cough (can be severe)
  - Sore throat
  - Rhinorrhea
  - Nasal congestion
- Duration: 3-7 days (cough may persist for weeks)

**Severe influenza**:
- Hypoxemia, respiratory failure
- Secondary bacterial pneumonia (S. pneumoniae, S. aureus including MRSA)
- Exacerbation of chronic conditions (asthma, COPD, heart failure)
- Myocarditis, encephalitis (rare)

**Risk factors for complications**:
- Age: <2 years, >65 years
- Pregnancy
- Chronic medical conditions: Asthma, COPD, heart disease, diabetes, immunosuppression
- Obesity (BMI ≥40)
- Nursing home residents

### Diagnosis

**Clinical diagnosis**:
- During influenza season: High positive predictive value

- Cannot reliably distinguish from other respiratory viruses

**Laboratory confirmation**:

*Rapid influenza diagnostic tests (RIDTs)*:
- Detects viral antigens
- Results: 10-15 minutes
- Sensitivity: 50-70%, Specificity: 90-95%
- False negatives common

*Molecular tests (preferred)*:
- **RT-PCR**: Gold standard
  - Sensitivity: >95%, Specificity: >95%
  - Detects and differentiates influenza A/B subtypes
  - Results: 1-6 hours
- **Rapid molecular assays**: Point-of-care, 15-30 minutes

*Viral culture*:
- Slow (3-10 days), used for surveillance and resistance testing

*Serology*:
- Fourfold rise in antibody titer (convalescent vs. acute)
- Retrospective diagnosis only

**Imaging**:
- Chest X-ray: If pneumonia suspected
- Findings: Bilateral interstitial infiltrates (viral pneumonia), lobar consolidation (bacterial superinfection)

### Treatment

**Antiviral therapy**:

*Neuraminidase inhibitors*:
- **Oseltamivir** (Tamiflu):
  - Dose: 75 mg PO BID × 5 days
  - Most commonly used
  - Reduces symptom duration by 1 day if started within 48 hours
  - Benefits extend beyond 48 hours in hospitalized patients
- **Zanamivir** (Relenza):
  - Dose: 10 mg inhaled BID × 5 days
  - Avoid in asthma/COPD (bronchospasm risk)
- **Peramivir**:
  - Dose: 600 mg IV single dose
  - For hospitalized patients unable to take oral/inhaled therapy

*Cap-dependent endonuclease inhibitor*:
- **Baloxavir marboxil** (Xofluza):
  - Dose: 40-80 mg PO single dose (weight-based)
  - Active against oseltamivir-resistant strains
  - Rapid symptom relief
  - Resistance can emerge during therapy

*Indications for antiviral therapy*:
- Hospitalized patients (regardless of symptom duration)
- Severe, complicated, or progressive illness
- High-risk patients (see risk factors above)
- Outpatients with symptom onset ≤48 hours (optional for low-risk)

**Supportive care**:
- Hydration

- Avoid aspirin in children (Reye syndrome risk)
- Cough suppressants, decongestants as needed

**Antibiotics**:
- Not routinely indicated
- Use only if secondary bacterial infection suspected (purulent sputum, lobar consolidation, leukocytosis)

### Prevention

**Vaccination** (most effective):
- **Inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV)**: IM injection
- **Live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV)**: Intranasal spray
- **Recombinant influenza vaccine (RIV)**: For egg allergy

*Recommendations*:
- Annual vaccination for all persons ≥6 months
- Optimal timing: September-October (before influenza season)
- Updated annually based on predicted circulating strains

*Efficacy*:
- Varies by season, strain match, age
- Overall: 40-60% reduction in influenza illness
- Reduces severity even when infection occurs

*Contraindications*:
- Severe egg allergy (use RIV or cell-culture IIV)
- History of severe reaction to vaccine
- LAIV: Immunosuppression, pregnancy, age <2 or >49 years

**Chemoprophylaxis**:

- Indications: High-risk unvaccinated individuals during outbreaks, immunocompromised with poor vaccine response
- Duration: 10 days (outbreak exposure) or entire influenza season
- Not a substitute for vaccination

**Infection control**:
- Hand hygiene
- Respiratory etiquette (cover cough)
- Isolation of infected patients (droplet precautions)
- Avoid crowded places during outbreaks

## Hepatitis A Virus (HAV)

### Overview

Hepatitis A is an acute, self-limited viral hepatitis transmitted via the fecal-oral route. It does not cause chronic infection but can lead to fulminant hepatic failure in rare cases.

  - **Immune-active**: Elevated ALT, active hepatitis, HBeAg positive or negative
  - **Inactive carrier**: HBsAg positive, low/undetectable HBV DNA, normal ALT
  - **HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis**: HBeAg negative, anti-HBe positive, elevated ALT, fluctuating HBV DNA
- Progressive fibrosis → cirrhosis (8-20% over 5 years)
- Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) risk: 2-5% per year in cirrhosis

**Risk factors for chronicity**:
- Age at infection: Neonates 90%, children 20-50%, adults 5%

## Hepatitis C Virus (HCV)

### Overview

Hepatitis C is a blood-borne viral infection causing chronic hepatitis in 70-85% of cases. It is the leading indication for liver transplantation in the United States and a major cause of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma.

### Virology and Epidemiology

**Virus characteristics**:
- Enveloped, single-stranded RNA virus (flavivirus family)
- High mutation rate (quasi-species, escape from immunity)
- No DNA intermediate (unlike HBV)
- Seven genotypes (1-7), multiple subtypes
  - Genotype 1: Most common in U.S. (75%)
  - Genotypes affect treatment response (historical significance, less relevant with DAAs)

**Epidemiology**:
- Global: 58 million chronic infections
- United States: 2.4 million (increasing due to opioid epidemic)
- Most common blood-borne infection in U.S.
- Leading cause of liver transplantation

**Transmission**:
- Percutaneous: IV drug use (most common in U.S.), needlestick, tattoos
- Blood transfusion: Rare post-1992 (screening implemented)
- Sexual transmission: Low risk (higher in HIV-positive MSM)
- Perinatal: 5% transmission rate (higher if maternal HIV co-infection)
- Household: Sharing razors, toothbrushes
- Incubation period: 14-180 days (average 6-7 weeks)

### Pathophysiology

**Acute infection**:
- Virus infects hepatocytes, rapid replication
- 15-30% spontaneous clearance (stronger in young females, IL28B CC genotype)
- 70-85% develop chronic infection (silent progression)

**Chronic infection**:
- Persistent viremia and inflammation
- Progressive fibrosis (rate varies: 10-40 years to cirrhosis)
- Cirrhosis: 20% within 20-30 years
- HCC risk: 1-4% per year in cirrhosis
- No effective immune response (continuous mutations)

**Extrahepatic manifestations**:
- Mixed cryoglobulinemia (vasculitis, purpura, arthralgia, glomerulonephritis)
- Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis
- Porphyria cutanea tarda
- Lichen planus
- B-cell lymphoma
- Autoimmune phenomena

### Clinical Presentation

**Acute hepatitis C**:
- Asymptomatic: 70-80%
- Symptomatic acute hepatitis: 20-30% (jaundice, fatigue, nausea)
- Fulminant hepatic failure: Extremely rare
- Most patients unaware of acute infection

**Chronic hepatitis C**:
- Asymptomatic: Majority until advanced disease
- Nonspecific symptoms: Fatigue (most common), malaise
- Cirrhosis complications: Ascites, bleeding, encephalopathy, HCC
- Diagnosed incidentally (abnormal LFTs, blood donation screening)

### Diagnosis

**Screening recommendations**:
- All adults aged 18-79 years (one-time, universal screening)
- High-risk populations: IV drug users, HIV, dialysis, incarcerated, blood transfusion pre-1992
- Pregnant women (all pregnancies)

**Serologic testing**:
- **Anti-HCV antibody**:
  - Screening test (ELISA)
  - Positive: Current or past infection
  - False negative: Immunosuppressed, acute infection (window period 4-10 weeks)
  - Does not distinguish active vs. cleared infection

**Virologic testing**:
- **HCV RNA** (PCR):
  - Confirms active infection
  - Quantitative (viral load): For monitoring treatment response
  - If anti-HCV positive, always check HCV RNA

**Genotype**:
- Determines treatment regimen (though most DAAs are pan-genotypic)
- Check before starting therapy

**Liver function tests**:
- ALT, AST: Often mildly elevated, may be normal
- Normal ALT does not exclude significant fibrosis

**Assess fibrosis**:
- Non-invasive preferred: FibroScan, APRI, FIB-4
- Liver biopsy: Rarely needed

**HCC surveillance**:
- Ultrasound ± AFP every 6 months if cirrhosis

### Treatment

**Goals**:
- Cure (sustained virologic response, SVR): Undetectable HCV RNA 12 weeks post-treatment
- Prevent cirrhosis, HCC, liver-related death
- Prevent transmission

**Direct-acting antivirals (DAAs)**:
- Revolutionized HCV treatment (cure rate >95%)
- Oral therapy, short duration (8-12 weeks)
- Well-tolerated, minimal side effects
- Pan-genotypic regimens available

**Recommended regimens** (2023 AASLD/IDSA guidelines):

*Treatment-naive, non-cirrhotic*:
- **Sofosbuvir/velpatasvir** (Epclusa): 400/100 mg PO daily × 12 weeks
  - Pan-genotypic
- **Glecaprevir/pibrentasvir** (Mavyret): 300/120 mg PO daily × 8 weeks
  - Pan-genotypic
  - Contraindicated in decompensated cirrhosis

*Compensated cirrhosis*:
- Sofosbuvir/velpatasvir × 12 weeks
- Glecaprevir/pibrentasvir × 12 weeks (if no prior DAA failure)

*Decompensated cirrhosis*:
- Sofosbuvir/velpatasvir × 12 weeks
- Add ribavirin if genotype 3 or prior DAA failure

*Prior DAA failure*:
- Sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir (Vosevi) × 12 weeks

**Drug classes**:
- **NS5A inhibitors**: Ledipasvir, velpatasvir, pibrentasvir (block viral replication)
- **NS5B polymerase inhibitors**: Sofosbuvir (nucleotide analog)
- **NS3/4A protease inhibitors**: Glecaprevir, voxilaprevir

**Monitoring**:
- HCV RNA at week 4 (optional), end of treatment, 12 weeks post-treatment (SVR12)
- SVR12: Cure (>99% remain HCV RNA negative)

**Complications**:
- DAAs generally well-tolerated
- Drug-drug interactions: Check for interactions with concomitant medications
- Hepatitis B reactivation: Screen for HBsAg, anti-HBc before DAA therapy

**Special populations**:
- Chronic kidney disease: Glecaprevir/pibrentasvir (no dose adjustment)
- HIV co-infection: Same regimens (check drug interactions with ART)
- Post-liver transplant: DAA therapy prevents recurrence, treats recurrent HCV

### Prevention

**No vaccine available**

**Harm reduction**:
- Needle exchange programs
- Opioid substitution therapy
- Education for injection drug users

**Screening and treatment**:
- Universal screening
- Treat all HCV-infected persons (cure prevents transmission)

**Infection control**:
- Standard precautions in healthcare
- Do not share personal items (razors, toothbrushes)

**Post-exposure**:
- No effective post-exposure prophylaxis
- Test source and exposed person
- Monitor anti-HCV and ALT at baseline, 3-6 months
- Treat if HCV RNA becomes positive

## Cytomegalovirus (CMV)

## Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV)

### Overview

Epstein-Barr virus is a ubiquitous herpesvirus that causes infectious mononucleosis in adolescents and young adults. It is associated with several malignancies and causes severe disease in immunocompromised hosts.

### Virology and Epidemiology

**Virus characteristics**:
- Enveloped, double-stranded DNA virus (herpesvirus family, HHV-4)
- Tropism for B lymphocytes
- Establishes latency in memory B cells

**Epidemiology**:
- Seroprevalence: >90% of adults worldwide
- Primary infection:
  - Developing countries: Early childhood (asymptomatic)
  - Developed countries: Adolescence/young adulthood (infectious mononucleosis)
- Transmission: Saliva ("kissing disease"), rarely blood transfusion

### Pathophysiology

- EBV infects B cells via CD21 receptor
- B cell proliferation (polyclonal)
- Vigorous T cell response (atypical lymphocytes)
- Latency in memory B cells (lifelong)
- Reactivation usually asymptomatic

### Clinical Presentation

**Infectious mononucleosis**:
- Classic triad:
  - **Fever**: Prolonged (1-2 weeks)
  - **Pharyngitis**: Exudative, severe
  - **Lymphadenopathy**: Cervical (posterior more than anterior), generalized
- Other features:
  - **Splenomegaly**: 50% (splenic rupture risk)
  - **Hepatomegaly**: 10-15%, mild hepatitis
  - **Rash**: 5-10% (90% if given ampicillin/amoxicillin)
  - Fatigue: Severe, prolonged (weeks to months)
  - Palatal petechiae
- Complications:
  - Splenic rupture (rare, 0.1-0.5%, avoid contact sports × 3-4 weeks)
  - Airway obstruction (tonsillar hypertrophy)
  - Hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia
  - Neurologic: Meningitis, encephalitis, Guillain-Barré syndrome
  - Myocarditis, pericarditis (rare)

**Chronic active EBV** (rare):
- Persistent or recurrent symptoms >6 months
- Elevated EBV DNA
- More common in Asia
- Can progress to lymphoproliferative disease

**Immunocompromised hosts**:
- **Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD)**:
  - B-cell proliferation due to immunosuppression
  - Risk highest in EBV-seronegative recipients (primary infection)
  - Presents as lymphadenopathy, mass lesions
  - Treatment: Reduce immunosuppression, rituximab, chemotherapy
- **Oral hairy leukoplakia**: White plaques on lateral tongue (AIDS, CD4 <200)

**EBV-associated malignancies**:
- Burkitt lymphoma (endemic in Africa)
- Hodgkin lymphoma (50% of cases)
- Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (endemic in Southeast Asia)
- Primary CNS lymphoma (AIDS)
- Gastric carcinoma (10%)

### Diagnosis

**Heterophile antibody test** (Monospot):
- Detects IgM antibodies that cross-react with sheep/horse RBCs
- Sensitivity: 70-90% (false negative in first week, children <4 years)
- Specificity: 95%
- Rapid, inexpensive

**EBV-specific serology**:

*Acute infection*:
- **VCA-IgM**: Positive (appears early, lasts 4-6 weeks)
- **VCA-IgG**: Positive (appears early, persists lifelong)
- **EBNA IgG**: Negative (appears after 2-4 months)
- **Early antigen (EA)**: Positive (variable)

*Past infection*:
- VCA-IgM: Negative
- VCA-IgG: Positive
- EBNA IgG: Positive

**EBV PCR**:
- Quantitative viral load (blood, CSF)
- Used in immunocompromised patients (PTLD monitoring)

**Complete blood count**:
- Leukocytosis (10,000-20,000)
- Lymphocytosis (>50%)
- **Atypical lymphocytes** (>10%, activated CD8+ T cells)
- Thrombocytopenia (mild)

**Liver function tests**:
- Mild transaminase elevation (2-3× ULN) in 80%

### Treatment

**Infectious mononucleosis**:
- **Supportive care**:
  - Rest, hydration
  - Acetaminophen, NSAIDs for fever/pain
  - Avoid aspirin in children
  - Avoid contact sports × 3-4 weeks (splenic rupture risk)
- **Corticosteroids**:
  - Indications: Airway obstruction, severe thrombocytopenia, hemolytic anemia
  - Not routinely recommended (does not shorten illness)
- **Antivirals**:
  - Acyclovir/valacyclovir: Not effective (no benefit in trials)
  - EBV not susceptible during latency
- **Antibiotics**:
  - Avoid ampicillin/amoxicillin (causes rash)
  - If given for suspected bacterial pharyngitis

**PTLD**:
- Reduce immunosuppression
- Rituximab (anti-CD20)
- Chemotherapy if refractory

### Prevention

- No vaccine available
- Avoid saliva contact with infected individuals
- Blood donor screening (not routine)

## Key Points

- Influenza causes seasonal epidemics with significant morbidity; neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir) reduce symptom duration when started early, and annual vaccination is the most effective prevention
- Hepatitis A is acute, self-limited, transmitted fecal-orally; vaccination is highly effective and recommended for all children and high-risk adults
- Hepatitis B can cause chronic infection leading to cirrhosis and HCC; perinatal and childhood infections have highest chronicity rates; treatment with nucleos(t)ide analogs (entecavir, tenofovir) suppresses viral replication; universal vaccination has dramatically reduced incidence
- Hepatitis C causes chronic infection in 70-85% and is the leading cause of liver transplantation; direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) cure >95% with 8-12 weeks of oral therapy
- CMV causes severe disease in immunocompromised patients (retinitis, pneumonitis, colitis) and is the leading infectious cause of congenital neurologic disability; ganciclovir/valganciclovir are first-line treatments
- EBV causes infectious mononucleosis with classic triad of fever, pharyngitis, and lymphadenopathy; treatment is supportive, and ampicillin causes rash in 90%
- Ebola virus disease is a severe hemorrhagic fever with high mortality; early treatment with monoclonal antibodies reduces mortality; infection control and vaccination (rVSV-ZEBOV) are critical for outbreak control
