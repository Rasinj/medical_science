# Infectious Diseases

## Overview

Infectious diseases is the medical specialty focused on the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of infections caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites. Infectious disease specialists manage complex infections, antimicrobial-resistant organisms, infections in immunocompromised hosts, tropical diseases, and emerging infectious threats. The field requires expertise in microbiology, immunology, epidemiology, and antimicrobial stewardship.

### Epidemiology

**Global burden**:
- Leading cause of death worldwide (historically)
- Lower respiratory infections, diarrheal diseases, tuberculosis among top 10 causes of death globally
- HIV/AIDS: 38 million people living with HIV (2020)
- Tuberculosis: 10 million new cases, 1.5 million deaths annually
- Malaria: 241 million cases, 627,000 deaths annually (2020)

**United States**:
- Healthcare-associated infections (HAIs): 1.7 million infections, 99,000 deaths annually
- Antimicrobial resistance: Major public health threat, >2.8 million resistant infections annually
- Emerging infections: COVID-19, monkeypox, Zika virus
- Bioterrorism concerns: Anthrax, smallpox, plague

### Principles of Infectious Diseases

**Host factors**:
- Immune status (immunocompetent vs immunocompromised)
- Age extremes (very young, elderly)
- Underlying diseases (diabetes, cirrhosis, malignancy, HIV)
- Medications (immunosuppressants, biologics)
- Anatomic defects (asplenia, prosthetic valves/joints)

**Pathogen factors**:
- Virulence (invasiveness, toxin production)
- Antimicrobial resistance
- Inoculum size
- Route of transmission

**Environmental factors**:
- Healthcare exposure (hospital, nursing home, dialysis)
- Travel history (geographic exposures)
- Occupational exposures
- Animal contacts
- Sexual practices

## Major Infectious Syndromes

### Sepsis and Septic Shock

**Definitions** (Sepsis-3):
- **Sepsis**: Life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by dysregulated host response to infection (SOFA score ≥2)
- **Septic shock**: Sepsis with vasopressor requirement and lactate >2 mmol/L despite adequate fluid resuscitation (mortality >40%)

**Recognition**:
- qSOFA (quick SOFA): Altered mental status, systolic BP ≤100, respiratory rate ≥22 (≥2 positive = high risk)
- SIRS criteria: Fever/hypothermia, tachycardia, tachypnea, leukocytosis/leukopenia (less specific)

**Management**:
- Early recognition and treatment (within 1 hour)
- Blood cultures before antibiotics
- Broad-spectrum empiric antibiotics (within 1 hour)
- Fluid resuscitation (30 mL/kg crystalloid)
- Vasopressors if hypotensive (norepinephrine first-line)
- Source control (drain abscesses, remove infected devices)

### Fever in Immunocompromised Hosts

**Neutropenic fever**:
- Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) <500 cells/μL + fever ≥38.3°C
- Medical emergency (high mortality if untreated)
- Empiric antibiotics: Antipseudomonal beta-lactam (cefepime, piperacillin-tazobactam, meropenem)
- Add vancomycin if skin/soft tissue infection, hemodynamic instability, known MRSA
- Add antifungal if persistent fever >4-7 days

**HIV/AIDS**:
- CD4 count determines risk of opportunistic infections
- CD4 <200: PCP, toxoplasmosis, cryptococcosis
- CD4 <50: MAC, CMV
- Prophylaxis critical (TMP-SMX, azithromycin)

**Transplant recipients**:
- Timeline post-transplant guides differential
- <1 month: Surgical complications, nosocomial infections
- 1-6 months: CMV, EBV, PCP (peak immunosuppression)
- >6 months: Community-acquired infections, chronic viral infections

### Central Nervous System Infections

**Meningitis**:
- Bacterial: Medical emergency, high mortality
- Viral: Usually benign, supportive care
- Fungal/TB: Chronic, immunocompromised
- Lumbar puncture critical for diagnosis

**Encephalitis**:
- HSV most common treatable cause
- Empiric acyclovir until HSV excluded
- MRI: Temporal lobe involvement (HSV)

### Endocarditis

**Infective endocarditis**:
- Vegetation on heart valve
- Duke criteria for diagnosis
- Blood cultures before antibiotics (3 sets from different sites)
- Prolonged IV antibiotics (4-6 weeks)
- Indications for surgery: Heart failure, abscess, persistent bacteremia, large vegetation with emboli

### Respiratory Tract Infections

**Pneumonia**:
- Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP)
- Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP)
- Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)
- Severity scores: CURB-65, PSI

**Tuberculosis**:
- Latent TB vs active TB
- RIPE therapy (rifampin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, ethambutol)
- Multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB)

### Intra-Abdominal Infections

**Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis**:
- Ascites infection in cirrhosis
- Diagnose: Ascitic fluid PMN ≥250 cells/μL
- Empiric cefotaxime or ceftriaxone

**Secondary peritonitis**:
- Perforated viscus, appendicitis, diverticulitis
- Source control + broad-spectrum antibiotics

### Urinary Tract Infections

**Cystitis vs pyelonephritis**:
- Cystitis: Lower tract, dysuria, frequency, urgency
- Pyelonephritis: Upper tract, fever, flank pain, systemic symptoms

**Complicated UTI**:
- Urologic abnormality, instrumentation, pregnancy, immunocompromised
- Broader antibiotic coverage, longer duration

### Skin and Soft Tissue Infections

**Cellulitis**:
- Bacterial (Streptococcus, Staphylococcus)
- Antibiotics covering strep ± MRSA (if risk factors)

**Necrotizing fasciitis**:
- Surgical emergency
- Early debridement + antibiotics

**Diabetic foot infections**:
- Polymicrobial
- Assess for osteomyelitis (probe-to-bone test, MRI)

## Antimicrobial Stewardship

**Principles**:
- Right drug, right dose, right duration
- Narrow spectrum when possible
- De-escalate based on culture results
- Avoid unnecessary antibiotics

**Antimicrobial resistance**:
- MRSA (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus)
- VRE (vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus)
- ESBL (extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing Enterobacteriaceae)
- CRE (carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae)
- Multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter

**Strategies**:
- Antibiotic time-outs (48-72 hours)
- Prospective audit and feedback
- Formulary restrictions
- Clinical decision support
- Education

## Diagnostic Approach

**Clinical assessment**:
- Detailed history (exposures, travel, animals, sexual, occupational)
- Physical examination (focus on infection source)

**Laboratory**:
- Blood cultures (before antibiotics)
- Complete blood count, inflammatory markers (CRP, procalcitonin)
- Urinalysis, urine culture
- Sputum culture, respiratory viral panel
- Cerebrospinal fluid analysis (if meningitis suspected)

**Imaging**:
- Chest X-ray (pneumonia)
- CT scan (abscess, complicated infections)
- Echocardiography (endocarditis)

**Microbiology**:
- Culture and susceptibility testing
- Rapid diagnostics (MRSA PCR, respiratory viral PCR, blood culture identification)
- Serology (acute and convalescent titers)
- Molecular testing (PCR for TB, fungal assays)

## Emerging Infectious Diseases

**Recent outbreaks**:
- COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2 pandemic)
- Ebola virus disease
- Zika virus
- Monkeypox (mpox)

**One Health approach**:
- Interconnection of human, animal, environmental health
- Zoonotic diseases (>60% of emerging infections)

**Pandemic preparedness**:
- Surveillance systems
- Vaccine development
- Public health infrastructure

## Infection Prevention and Control

**Standard precautions**:
- Hand hygiene (most important)
- Personal protective equipment (PPE)
- Safe injection practices
- Respiratory hygiene

**Transmission-based precautions**:
- Contact (MRSA, VRE, C. difficile)
- Droplet (influenza, pertussis, meningococcal)
- Airborne (tuberculosis, measles, varicella)

**Healthcare-associated infections**:
- Central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSI)
- Catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTI)
- Surgical site infections (SSI)
- Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)
- C. difficile infection

## Vaccines and Immunization

**Routine adult immunizations**:
- Influenza (annual)
- Tdap/Td (tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis)
- MMR (measles, mumps, rubella)
- Varicella (if non-immune)
- Zoster (shingles): RZV (Shingrix) preferred, age ≥50
- Pneumococcal (PCV20 or PCV15 + PPSV23): Age ≥65, risk factors
- Hepatitis A, B (risk factors)
- HPV (through age 26, consider to 45)
- COVID-19

**Immunocompromised patients**:
- Live vaccines generally contraindicated
- Inactivated vaccines safe but may have reduced immunogenicity
- Timing relative to immunosuppression important

## Travel Medicine

**Pre-travel consultation**:
- Destination-specific risks
- Vaccinations (yellow fever, typhoid, hepatitis A, meningococcal, rabies)
- Malaria prophylaxis
- Traveler's diarrhea prevention and self-treatment
- Insect bite prevention

**Post-travel fever**:
- Malaria (always consider)
- Dengue, chikungunya, Zika
- Typhoid fever
- Viral hemorrhagic fevers (rare)
- COVID-19

## Key Points

- Sepsis is defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction (SOFA ≥2) from infection; septic shock requires vasopressors and lactate >2 mmol/L despite fluids
- Early recognition and treatment of sepsis (antibiotics within 1 hour, fluid resuscitation, source control) dramatically improves outcomes
- Neutropenic fever (ANC <500 + fever ≥38.3°C) is a medical emergency requiring immediate broad-spectrum antipseudomonal antibiotics
- Antimicrobial stewardship focuses on right drug, dose, and duration; de-escalation based on cultures prevents resistance
- Healthcare-associated infections (CLABSI, CAUTI, SSI, VAP, C. difficile) are preventable through evidence-based protocols and adherence to infection control practices
