# Coronary Artery Disease

## Overview

Coronary artery disease (CAD), also known as ischemic heart disease, is a condition characterized by inadequate blood supply to the myocardium due to atherosclerotic narrowing or occlusion of the coronary arteries. CAD is the leading cause of death globally, responsible for approximately one-third of all deaths in people over 35 years of age.

### Definition and Classification

**Coronary artery disease spectrum**:
- **Asymptomatic CAD**: Atherosclerosis without clinical manifestations
- **Stable ischemic heart disease**: Predictable angina with exertion
- **Acute coronary syndromes (ACS)**: Unstable angina, NSTEMI, STEMI
- **Chronic total occlusion**: Complete blockage with stable collaterals
- **Ischemic cardiomyopathy**: Heart failure due to chronic ischemia

**Anatomic classification**:
- Single-vessel disease
- Two-vessel disease
- Three-vessel disease (LAD, LCx, RCA)
- Left main disease (highest risk)

### Epidemiology

**Global burden**:
- Leading cause of death worldwide (9.4 million deaths annually)
- Accounts for 16% of total deaths globally
- Prevalence increases with age
- Men affected earlier than women (10-year difference)
- Rising incidence in developing countries

**Risk factors distribution**:
- 90% of myocardial infarctions attributable to modifiable risk factors
- Hypertension, smoking, and diabetes account for majority of risk
- Regional variations based on lifestyle and genetics
- Decreasing mortality in developed countries due to prevention and treatment

## Pathophysiology

### Atherosclerosis Development

**Endothelial dysfunction**:
- Initial event in atherogenesis
- Triggered by risk factors: hyperlipidemia, hypertension, smoking, diabetes
- Reduced nitric oxide production
- Increased oxidative stress
- Enhanced inflammatory response
- Increased endothelial permeability

**Lipoprotein modification**:
- LDL particles penetrate damaged endothelium
- Oxidative modification of LDL in intima
- Oxidized LDL is pro-inflammatory and cytotoxic
- Stimulates expression of adhesion molecules (VCAM-1, ICAM-1)
- Recruits monocytes to vessel wall

**Inflammatory cascade**:
- Monocyte adhesion via selectins and integrins
- Migration into intima mediated by chemokines (MCP-1)
- Differentiation into macrophages
- Scavenger receptor-mediated uptake of oxidized LDL
- Formation of lipid-laden foam cells

**Plaque evolution**:
- **Fatty streak**: Earliest lesion, lipid-laden foam cells
- **Fibrous plaque**: Smooth muscle cell proliferation, collagen deposition, fibrous cap formation
- **Advanced/complicated plaque**: Large necrotic core, thin fibrous cap, calcification
- **Vulnerable plaque**: High risk of rupture

**Plaque progression mechanisms**:
- Continued lipid accumulation
- Smooth muscle cell migration and proliferation
- Extracellular matrix synthesis
- Inflammatory cell infiltration
- Neovascularization from vasa vasorum
- Intraplaque hemorrhage
- Calcification (hydroxyapatite deposition)

### Plaque Vulnerability and Rupture

**Vulnerable plaque characteristics**:
- Thin fibrous cap (<65 micrometers)
- Large lipid-rich necrotic core (>40% of plaque volume)
- Active inflammation (abundant macrophages and T cells)
- Reduced smooth muscle cells in cap
- Outward (positive) remodeling
- Superficial calcification
- Intraplaque hemorrhage

**Mechanisms of plaque disruption**:

1. **Plaque rupture** (60-70% of ACS):
   - Mechanical stress on thin fibrous cap
   - Cap disruption exposes thrombogenic core
   - Platelet adhesion and aggregation
   - Coagulation cascade activation
   - Thrombus formation

2. **Plaque erosion** (20-30% of ACS):
   - Endothelial denudation without cap rupture
   - More common in women, diabetics, smokers
   - Exposure of subendothelial matrix
   - Platelet adhesion to exposed collagen
   - Less inflammatory than rupture

3. **Calcified nodule** (2-5% of ACS):
   - Protrusion of calcified mass through thin fibrous cap
   - Associated with multiple healed ruptures
   - More common in elderly, chronic kidney disease

**Thrombosis formation**:
- Exposure of tissue factor (major trigger)
- Platelet adhesion via vWF and GPIb
- Platelet activation: Shape change, granule release, GPIIb/IIIa expression
- Platelet aggregation: Fibrinogen bridges between platelets
- Thrombin generation via coagulation cascade
- Fibrin mesh stabilizes platelet plug
- Red blood cells entrapped in thrombus

**Dynamic thrombosis**:
- Thrombus may be occlusive or non-occlusive
- Recurrent rupture and thrombosis
- Embolization of platelet aggregates
- Spontaneous lysis and reformation
- Vasospasm contributes to ischemia

### Myocardial Ischemia

**Supply-demand mismatch**:
- Oxygen supply: Coronary blood flow, oxygen-carrying capacity
- Oxygen demand: Heart rate, contractility, wall tension
- Ischemia occurs when demand exceeds supply

**Determinants of coronary blood flow**:
- Coronary perfusion pressure (aortic diastolic pressure - LVEDP)
- Duration of diastole
- Coronary vascular resistance
- Autoregulation (metabolic, endothelial, myogenic)
- Collateral circulation

**Ischemic cascade**:
1. Reduced coronary flow
2. Metabolic abnormalities (ATP depletion, lactate accumulation)
3. Diastolic dysfunction (impaired relaxation)
4. Systolic dysfunction (reduced contractility)
5. ECG changes (ST-segment changes, T wave inversion)
6. Angina symptoms

**Severity and duration**:
- Mild ischemia: Reversible dysfunction (stunning)
- Severe ischemia: Irreversible injury after 20-40 minutes
- Coagulation necrosis develops
- Infarct size depends on territory, collaterals, duration

### Adaptive Responses

**Coronary collaterals**:
- Pre-existing vessels enlarge in response to ischemia
- Arteriogenesis: Growth of collateral vessels
- Provides alternative blood supply
- More developed in chronic stable CAD than acute occlusion
- Protective against infarction

**Myocardial hibernation**:
- Chronic downregulation of function to match reduced flow
- Viable myocardium with reduced contractility
- Reversible with revascularization
- Detected by viability testing (PET, dobutamine echo, cardiac MRI)

**Ischemic preconditioning**:
- Brief ischemic episodes protect against subsequent prolonged ischemia
- Reduced infarct size
- Mechanisms: Adenosine, ATP-sensitive K+ channels, PKC activation
- Clinical relevance: Preinfarction angina may be protective

## Clinical Presentation

### Stable Angina Pectoris

**Typical angina characteristics**:
- **Location**: Retrosternal, left chest, may radiate to arms, neck, jaw, back
- **Quality**: Pressure, tightness, squeezing, heaviness, burning
- **Duration**: 2-10 minutes, resolves with rest or nitroglycerin

- Most sensitive and specific marker
- Detectable 2-4 hours after injury
- Peak: 12-48 hours
- Duration: 7-14 days
- High-sensitivity troponin: Earlier detection, lower cutoffs
- Serial measurements improve sensitivity
- 0 and 1-hour algorithms for rapid rule-out

- Rises 3-6 hours, peaks 12-24 hours
- Returns to baseline 2-3 days
- Useful for detecting reinfarction
- Ratio CK-MB/total CK >2.5% suggests cardiac origin

**Myoglobin**:
- Early marker (rises within 1-2 hours)
- Low specificity (also elevated in skeletal muscle injury)
- Negative predictive value when measured serially
- Rarely used clinically

**Other biomarkers**:

- Treatment: Anticoagulation, consider surgical aneurysmectomy if symptomatic

**Mitral regurgitation**:
- Ischemic MR from papillary muscle dysfunction or LV remodeling
- Functional vs. structural
- Worsens heart failure
- Treatment: Optimize medical therapy, consider MitraClip or surgery

**Angina recurrence**:
- Progression of native disease
- Stent restenosis or thrombosis
- Graft occlusion (post-CABG)

## Prognosis

### Risk Stratification

**Clinical factors**:
- Age
- Diabetes mellitus
- Renal dysfunction
- Prior MI or revascularization
- Heart failure
- Peripheral arterial disease

**Anatomic factors**:
- Left main disease: 3-year mortality 30-40% without revascularization
- Three-vessel disease: Worse prognosis than one or two-vessel
- Proximal LAD involvement: Higher risk
- Chronic total occlusion: Marker of advanced CAD

**Functional factors**:
- LVEF: Most powerful predictor of mortality
  - EF >50%: Good prognosis
  - EF 35-50%: Intermediate risk
  - EF <35%: High risk, consider ICD
- Extent of ischemia on stress testing: >10% myocardium high risk
- Exercise capacity: Duke Treadmill Score

**Biomarkers**:
- Troponin elevation: Higher risk in ACS
- BNP/NT-proBNP: Prognostic in ACS and stable CAD
- hs-CRP: Inflammation correlates with events

### Outcomes with Treatment

**Medical therapy**:
- Aspirin: 25% reduction in MI, stroke, CV death
- Statins: 30% reduction in major adverse cardiac events per 40 mg/dL LDL reduction
- Beta-blockers post-MI: 25% mortality reduction
- ACE inhibitors post-MI: 20% mortality reduction in LV dysfunction
- P2Y12 inhibitors in ACS: 20% reduction in CV events

**Revascularization**:
- **PCI**: Improves symptoms and quality of life; mortality benefit in ACS but not stable CAD
- **CABG**: Mortality benefit in left main, three-vessel disease, especially with diabetes or reduced EF
- **Optimal medical therapy**: Equally effective as PCI for stable CAD in many patients (COURAGE, ISCHEMIA trials)

**Secondary prevention**:
- Comprehensive risk factor modification reduces recurrent events by 50-80%
- Cardiac rehabilitation improves outcomes
- Medication adherence critical

### Long-term Prognosis

**Stable CAD**:
- Annual mortality 1-2% with optimal medical therapy
- 5-year survival >90% in low-risk patients
- Quality of life excellent with symptom control

**Post-MI**:
- In-hospital mortality: STEMI 5-7%, NSTEMI 3-5%
- 1-year mortality: 10-15%
- Long-term prognosis depends on LV function and recurrent ischemia

**Advanced CAD**:
- Ischemic cardiomyopathy: 5-year survival 50%
- Improves with revascularization if viable myocardium

## Key Points

- Coronary artery disease results from atherosclerotic narrowing of coronary arteries, leading to myocardial ischemia
- Stable angina presents as predictable exertional chest discomfort; ACS presents as rest pain or crescendo symptoms
- Diagnosis involves clinical assessment, ECG, biomarkers, stress testing, and coronary angiography
- Medical management includes antiplatelet therapy, statins, beta-blockers, and ACE inhibitors
- Revascularization (PCI or CABG) indicated for specific anatomic and clinical scenarios
- Lifestyle modifications and cardiac rehabilitation are essential for secondary prevention
- Risk stratification guides intensity of treatment and prognosis
- Comprehensive management reduces cardiovascular events and improves survival
