# Heart Failure

## Overview

Heart failure (HF) is a complex clinical syndrome resulting from any structural or functional cardiac disorder that impairs the ability of the ventricle to fill with or eject blood. It represents the final common pathway for many cardiovascular diseases and is a major public health problem with significant morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs.

### Definition

**American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) Definition**:
A complex clinical syndrome with symptoms and signs that result from any structural or functional impairment of ventricular filling or ejection of blood.

**European Society of Cardiology (ESC) Definition**:
A clinical syndrome characterized by typical symptoms (breathlessness, ankle swelling, fatigue) accompanied by signs (elevated jugular venous pressure, pulmonary crackles, peripheral edema) caused by a structural and/or functional cardiac abnormality, resulting in reduced cardiac output and/or elevated intracardiac pressures at rest or during stress.

### Classification

**By ejection fraction**:
- **HFrEF** (Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction): EF ≤40%
- **HFmrEF** (Heart failure with mildly reduced ejection fraction): EF 41-49%
- **HFpEF** (Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction): EF ≥50%
- **HFimpEF** (Heart failure with improved ejection fraction): Previously ≤40%, now >40%

**By acuity**:
- **Acute heart failure**: New onset or rapid deterioration of signs/symptoms
- **Chronic heart failure**: Stable symptoms over time
- **Acute decompensated heart failure**: Worsening of chronic heart failure

**By symptoms (NYHA Functional Class)**:
- **Class I**: No limitation; ordinary physical activity does not cause symptoms
- **Class II**: Slight limitation; comfortable at rest, ordinary activity causes symptoms
- **Class III**: Marked limitation; comfortable at rest, less than ordinary activity causes symptoms
- **Class IV**: Severe limitation; symptoms at rest, any physical activity increases discomfort

**ACC/AHA Stages**:
- **Stage A**: At risk for HF but without structural heart disease or symptoms
- **Stage B**: Structural heart disease without signs or symptoms of HF
- **Stage C**: Structural heart disease with prior or current symptoms of HF
- **Stage D**: Refractory HF requiring specialized interventions

### Epidemiology

**Prevalence**:
- Affects >64 million people worldwide
- United States: 6.2 million adults (2.3% of population)
- Prevalence increases with age: <1% at age <50, >10% at age >70
- Lifetime risk: 20-25% at age 40

**Incidence**:
- ~650,000 new cases annually in the United States
- Increasing incidence due to aging population and improved survival from MI

**Mortality**:
- 5-year mortality: ~50% overall
- HFrEF: Higher mortality than HFpEF
- Worsens with advancing NYHA class
- Leading cause of hospitalization in adults >65 years

**Economic burden**:
- Annual cost: >$30 billion in the United States
- Direct medical costs: Hospitalizations account for 70%
- Readmission rate: 25% within 30 days, 50% within 6 months

## Pathophysiology

### Mechanisms of Myocardial Dysfunction

**Systolic dysfunction (HFrEF)**:
- Impaired ventricular contractility
- Reduced stroke volume
- Increased end-systolic volume
- Dilated ventricle with eccentric hypertrophy
- Reduced ejection fraction

**Common causes**:
- Ischemic heart disease (most common in developed countries)
- Dilated cardiomyopathy
- Valvular heart disease
- Chronic hypertension

**Diastolic dysfunction (HFpEF)**:
- Impaired ventricular relaxation and filling
- Increased ventricular stiffness
- Reduced compliance
- Normal or near-normal ejection fraction
- Elevated filling pressures

**Common causes**:
- Hypertensive heart disease with LVH
- Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
- Restrictive cardiomyopathy (infiltrative diseases)
- Constrictive pericarditis
- Aging

### Compensatory Mechanisms

**Frank-Starling mechanism**:
- Increased preload (ventricular filling) stretches myocardial fibers
- Enhanced cross-bridge formation
- Increased force of contraction
- Maintains cardiac output initially
- Eventually, excessive stretch reduces contractility (descending limb)

**Neurohormonal activation**:

*Sympathetic nervous system*:
- Increased norepinephrine release
- β1-adrenergic stimulation increases HR and contractility
- α1-adrenergic stimulation causes vasoconstriction
- Short-term benefit (maintains BP and perfusion)
- Long-term harm:
  - Increased myocardial oxygen demand
  - Arrhythmogenesis
  - Receptor downregulation and desensitization
  - Direct myocardial toxicity
  - Apoptosis

*Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS)*:
- Reduced renal perfusion stimulates renin release
- Angiotensin II effects:
  - Vasoconstriction (increases afterload)
  - Aldosterone secretion (sodium and water retention)
  - Myocardial fibrosis and remodeling
  - Sympathetic activation
- Aldosterone effects:
  - Sodium retention (increases preload)
  - Potassium and magnesium excretion
  - Myocardial fibrosis
  - Endothelial dysfunction

*Natriuretic peptides*:
- ANP (atrial natriuretic peptide) and BNP (B-type natriuretic peptide)
- Released in response to atrial and ventricular stretch
- Counter-regulatory effects:
  - Vasodilation
  - Natriuresis and diuresis
  - Inhibit RAAS and sympathetic nervous system
  - Antifibrotic effects
- Overwhelmed in chronic HF
- Degraded by neprilysin

*Antidiuretic hormone (ADH/vasopressin)*:
- Released in response to low cardiac output
- V2 receptor: Water retention (hyponatremia)
- V1a receptor: Vasoconstriction
- Contributes to volume overload

**Ventricular remodeling**:
- Progressive changes in ventricular size, shape, and function
- Myocyte hypertrophy
- Myocyte apoptosis and necrosis
- Interstitial fibrosis (collagen deposition)
- Chamber dilation (eccentric hypertrophy in HFrEF)
- Wall thickening (concentric hypertrophy in HFpEF)
- Spherical shape (from elliptical)
- Mitral annular dilation → functional mitral regurgitation
- Progressive worsening despite compensatory mechanisms

### Hemodynamic Alterations

**Forward failure**:
- Reduced cardiac output
- Inadequate tissue perfusion
- Symptoms: Fatigue, weakness, exercise intolerance
- End-organ hypoperfusion: Renal insufficiency, hepatic dysfunction

**Backward failure**:
- Elevated ventricular filling pressures
- Venous congestion

*Left-sided HF*:
- Elevated LA pressure
- Pulmonary venous hypertension
- Transudative fluid in alveoli (pulmonary edema)
- Symptoms: Dyspnea, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea
- Chronic: Pulmonary arterial hypertension, right heart failure

*Right-sided HF*:
- Elevated RA pressure
- Systemic venous congestion
- Peripheral edema, ascites, hepatomegaly
- Gastrointestinal congestion

**Cardiorenal syndrome**:
- Worsening renal function in HF
- Reduced renal perfusion
- Venous congestion impairs renal function
- RAAS activation worsens renal function
- Diuretic resistance

### Cellular and Molecular Mechanisms

**Excitation-contraction coupling defects**:
- Abnormal calcium handling
- Reduced sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca²⁺-ATPase (SERCA2a)
- Increased diastolic calcium leak
- Impaired contractility and relaxation

**Mitochondrial dysfunction**:
- Reduced ATP production
- Increased oxidative stress
- Mitochondrial DNA damage
- Apoptosis

**Inflammation and oxidative stress**:
- Elevated inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1, IL-6)
- Oxidative stress damages proteins, lipids, DNA
- Endothelial dysfunction
- Contributes to remodeling

**Myocardial fibrosis**:
- Excessive collagen deposition
- Increased ventricular stiffness
- Impaired diastolic function
- Substrate for arrhythmias

## Clinical Presentation

### Symptoms

**Cardinal symptoms**:
- **Dyspnea**: Exertional initially, progressive to rest

- Progressive HF: 50-60% of deaths

**Prognostic factors**:
- Low EF
- Advanced NYHA class
- Low peak VO₂ (<12-14 mL/kg/min)
- Elevated BNP/NT-proBNP
- Hyponatremia
- Renal dysfunction
- Hypotension
- Cardiac cachexia
- Wide QRS complex
- Frequent hospitalizations

**Risk scores**:
- Seattle Heart Failure Model
- MAGGIC risk score
- Predicts mortality, transplant-free survival

## Key Points

- Heart failure is a clinical syndrome resulting from structural or functional cardiac impairment, classified by EF (HFrEF, HFmrEF, HFpEF)
- Diagnosis requires symptoms, signs, and objective evidence of cardiac dysfunction (echo, biomarkers)
- Guideline-directed medical therapy for HFrEF includes ACE inhibitors/ARBs/ARNI, beta-blockers, MRAs, and SGLT2 inhibitors
- Diuretics provide symptomatic relief but do not improve mortality
- Device therapy (ICD, CRT) indicated in selected patients with reduced EF
- HFpEF management focuses on symptom control, BP management, and treatment of comorbidities
- Advanced therapies (LVAD, transplant) for refractory Stage D heart failure
- Prognosis depends on EF, functional class, biomarkers, and comorbidities
