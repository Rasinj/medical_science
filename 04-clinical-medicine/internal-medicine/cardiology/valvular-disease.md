# Valvular Heart Disease

## Overview

Valvular heart disease encompasses a broad spectrum of pathologic conditions affecting the cardiac valves, leading to stenosis (narrowing) or regurgitation (leakage). These conditions result in abnormal hemodynamics that can progress to heart failure, arrhythmias, and death if untreated. With an aging population and improvements in interventional therapies, valvular heart disease represents an increasing clinical challenge.

### Cardiac Valve Anatomy

**Aortic valve**:
- Trileaflet semilunar valve (right, left, and non-coronary cusps)
- Separates left ventricle from aorta
- Opens in systole, closes in diastole
- Normal area: 3-4 cm²
- Bicuspid variant: Most common congenital cardiac abnormality (1-2% population)

**Mitral valve**:
- Bileaflet valve (anterior and posterior leaflets)
- Separates left atrium from left ventricle
- Opens in diastole, closes in systole
- Normal area: 4-6 cm²
- Supported by chordae tendineae attached to papillary muscles

**Tricuspid valve**:
- Trileaflet valve (anterior, posterior, septal)
- Separates right atrium from right ventricle
- Normal area: 7-9 cm²

**Pulmonary valve**:
- Trileaflet semilunar valve
- Separates right ventricle from pulmonary artery
- Least commonly diseased valve

### Epidemiology

**Prevalence by valve**:
- Aortic stenosis: Most common, 2-7% of population >65 years
- Mitral regurgitation: Second most common
- Mitral stenosis: Declining in developed countries (rheumatic disease)
- Tricuspid and pulmonary valve disease: Less common as primary lesions

**Global burden**:
- Moderate-severe valvular disease: ~2.5% of population in developed countries
- Increases with age: >10% in those >75 years
- Rheumatic heart disease: Still prevalent in developing countries (275,000 deaths annually)

## Aortic Stenosis

### Etiology

**Degenerative (calcific) aortic stenosis**:
- Most common cause in developed countries
- "Wear and tear" with progressive calcification
- Risk factors: Age, hypertension, diabetes, smoking, dyslipidemia, chronic kidney disease
- Typically presents >65 years (tricuspid valve) or >50 years (bicuspid valve)
- Mechanistically similar to atherosclerosis: Lipid deposition, inflammation, calcification

**Bicuspid aortic valve**:
- Congenital fusion of two cusps (most commonly right and left)
- Prevalence: 1-2% of population
- Accelerated degeneration and calcification
- Earlier onset of stenosis (typically 40-60 years)
- Associated with aortopathy (aneurysm, dissection risk)

**Rheumatic aortic stenosis**:
- Result of rheumatic fever
- Commissural fusion and leaflet fibrosis
- Declining in developed countries
- Almost always associated with mitral valve disease
- Presents at younger age than degenerative AS

### Pathophysiology

**Hemodynamic consequences**:
- Progressive reduction in valve area (normal 3-4 cm²)
- Increased resistance to LV outflow
- Chronic pressure overload on left ventricle
- Compensatory concentric LV hypertrophy
  - Maintains systolic function initially
  - Normalizes wall stress (Laplace's law)
  - Increases myocardial oxygen demand
- Diastolic dysfunction (reduced compliance)
- Reduced coronary flow reserve
- Eventually, afterload exceeds compensatory mechanisms → LV systolic dysfunction

**Severity classification**:
- **Mild**: Valve area >1.5 cm², mean gradient <20 mmHg
- **Moderate**: Valve area 1.0-1.5 cm², mean gradient 20-40 mmHg
- **Severe**: Valve area <1.0 cm² (or <0.6 cm²/m²), mean gradient >40 mmHg, peak velocity >4 m/s

**Low-flow, low-gradient AS**:
- Severe AS by valve area but low gradient (<40 mmHg)
- **Classical**: Reduced EF, low stroke volume
- **Paradoxical**: Preserved EF, small LV cavity, low stroke volume
- Requires dobutamine stress echo to differentiate true severe AS from pseudostenosis

### Clinical Presentation

**Classic symptom triad** (indicates severe AS):
1. **Angina** (50-70%):
   - Increased oxygen demand from LVH
   - Reduced coronary perfusion pressure (shorter diastole, elevated LVEDP)
   - May occur without CAD

2. **Syncope** (15-30%):
   - Exertional: Inability to increase cardiac output with peripheral vasodilation
   - Arrhythmias: Atrial fibrillation, ventricular arrhythmias, heart block
   - Post-exertional vasodilation

3. **Heart failure** (50%):
   - Diastolic dysfunction initially
   - Systolic dysfunction in late disease
   - Dyspnea, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea

**Natural history**:
- Asymptomatic period: Variable (years to decades)
- Average rate of progression: Velocity increases 0.3 m/s/year, mean gradient increases 7 mmHg/year
- Once symptoms develop:
  - Angina: Mean survival 5 years
  - Syncope: Mean survival 3 years
  - Heart failure: Mean survival 2 years
- Sudden death: <1% per year if asymptomatic, increased with symptoms

**Physical examination**:
- **Systolic ejection murmur**:
  - Crescendo-decrescendo (diamond-shaped)
  - Loudest at right upper sternal border
  - Radiates to carotids
  - May radiate to apex (Gallavardin phenomenon)
  - Intensity does not correlate with severity
  - Diminishes as stenosis worsens (low cardiac output)
- **Decreased A2** (aortic component of S2): Calcified, immobile valve
- **Paradoxical splitting of S2**: Delayed aortic closure
- **S4 gallop**: LV hypertrophy, reduced compliance
- **Pulsus parvus et tardus**: Slow-rising, weak carotid pulse
- **Narrow pulse pressure**: Reduced stroke volume
- **Sustained, non-displaced apical impulse**: Concentric LVH

### Diagnosis

**Echocardiography** (definitive diagnostic test):
- **2D/3D imaging**:
  - Valve morphology: Tricuspid vs. bicuspid, calcification
  - Number and mobility of cusps
  - LV size, wall thickness, systolic function
  - Associated findings: Mitral disease, aortic root dilation

- **Doppler**:
  - **Peak velocity**: Normal <2 m/s; severe AS >4 m/s
  - **Mean gradient**: Pressure difference across valve
  - **Valve area** (continuity equation): Most accurate measure of severity
  - **Dimensionless index**: LVOT VTI / AV VTI (severe if <0.25)

- **Stress echocardiography**:
  - Asymptomatic severe AS: Exercise testing to assess symptoms, BP response
  - Low-flow, low-gradient AS: Dobutamine to differentiate true vs. pseudo-severe AS

**Cardiac catheterization**:
- Not routinely required
- Indications:
  - Discrepancy between clinical findings and echocardiography
  - Simultaneous coronary angiography before AVR
  - Invasive hemodynamic assessment
- Direct measurement of transvalvular gradient
- Gorlin equation for valve area calculation

**ECG**:
- LV hypertrophy (Sokolow-Lyon criteria, Cornell voltage)
- Left atrial enlargement
- Left axis deviation
- Conduction abnormalities (especially with calcification extension to conduction system)

**Chest X-ray**:
- Often normal
- Boot-shaped heart (LVH)
- Calcification of aortic valve
- Post-stenotic dilation of ascending aorta
- Pulmonary congestion (advanced disease)

**Cardiac CT**:
- Quantify aortic valve calcium (Agatston score)
- Predictor of severity and progression
- Pre-TAVR planning: Annular sizing, vascular access assessment

**Cardiac MRI**:
- Accurate LV volumes and mass
- Late gadolinium enhancement: Myocardial fibrosis (poor prognosis)

**Biomarkers**:
- BNP/NT-proBNP: Elevated in symptomatic AS, prognostic value
- Troponin: Elevated in severe AS, marker of increased risk

### Treatment

**Medical management**:
- **No proven medical therapy to halt progression**
- Management of comorbidities:
  - Hypertension: Careful titration, avoid precipitous drops in BP
  - Dyslipidemia: Statins may slow calcification (observational data)
  - Atrial fibrillation: Rate control, anticoagulation
- **Symptom relief**:
  - Diuretics for pulmonary congestion (careful, may reduce preload excessively)
  - Avoid vasodilators (reduce afterload → hypotension)
- **Avoid strenuous activity** in severe asymptomatic AS

**Indications for intervention** (ACC/AHA Guidelines):

*Class I* (definite):
- **Symptomatic** severe AS (any symptoms)
- **Asymptomatic** severe AS with:
  - LVEF <50%
  - Undergoing other cardiac surgery (CABG, other valve, aorta)
  - Abnormal exercise test (symptoms, hypotensive response)
  - Very severe AS (velocity >5 m/s or mean gradient >60 mmHg)

*Class IIa* (reasonable):
- Asymptomatic severe AS with:
  - Rapid progression (velocity increase ≥0.3 m/s/year)
  - Elevated BNP (>3× normal) without other explanation
  - Severe calcification and velocity >4 m/s with low-risk surgery

**Surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR)**:

*Valve options*:
- **Mechanical valves**:
  - Durability: Lifelong
  - Require lifelong anticoagulation (INR 2-3)
  - Preferred in younger patients (<60-65 years), long life expectancy
  - Types: Bileaflet (St. Jude, ATS), tilting disk, ball-cage (obsolete)

- **Bioprosthetic valves**:
  - No anticoagulation required (aspirin only)
  - Structural valve deterioration: 10-15 years (faster in young patients)
  - Preferred in older patients (>65-70 years), childbearing potential, contraindication to anticoagulation
  - Types: Stented, stentless, homograft, autograft (Ross procedure)

*Operative risk*:
- STS score or EuroSCORE II to estimate mortality risk
- Low risk: <4%, intermediate risk: 4-8%, high risk: >8%

*Outcomes*:
- Operative mortality: 1-3% (low risk), 3-8% (intermediate), >8% (high)
- Symptom improvement: >90%
- LV function improvement: Variable (better if done before irreversible dysfunction)
- Long-term survival: Similar to age-matched controls if timely intervention

**Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR)**:

*Indications*:
- Symptomatic severe AS
- Intermediate to high surgical risk (or low risk in selected patients based on age >65-80)
- Prohibitive surgical risk or contraindication to surgery
- Acceptable anatomy (annular size, no excessive calcification, adequate vascular access)

*Access routes*:
- **Transfemoral** (most common, preferred): Via femoral artery
- **Transapical**: LV apex via small thoracotomy
- **Transaortic**: Direct aortic access
- **Transcarotid, transaxillary**: Alternative arterial access

*Valve systems*:
- **Balloon-expandable**: Edwards SAPIEN (cobalt-chromium frame)
- **Self-expanding**: Medtronic CoreValve, Evolut (nitinol frame)

*Outcomes (compared to SAVR)*:
- **High/prohibitive risk**: TAVR superior to medical management, non-inferior to SAVR
- **Intermediate risk**: TAVR non-inferior to SAVR (PARTNER 2, SURTAVI trials)
- **Low risk**: TAVR non-inferior to SAVR (PARTNER 3, Evolut Low Risk trials)
- Faster recovery, shorter hospital stay
- Lower stroke risk with newer-generation devices

*Complications*:
- **Paravalvular leak**: Mild common (10-20%), moderate-severe associated with worse outcomes
- **Conduction abnormalities**: High-degree AV block requiring pacemaker (5-25%, higher with self-expanding)
- **Vascular complications**: Access site bleeding, dissection, perforation
- **Stroke**: 2-5% (embolic)
- **Acute kidney injury**: Contrast-induced
- **Valve thrombosis**: Rare (<1%), may require anticoagulation
- **Structural valve deterioration**: Long-term data emerging (appears acceptable to 5-8 years)

**Balloon aortic valvuloplasty**:
- Palliative procedure
- Indications (limited):
  - Bridge to SAVR/TAVR
  - Stabilization in cardiogenic shock
  - Diagnostic in low-flow, low-gradient AS
- High restenosis rate (6-12 months)
- Not recommended as definitive therapy

## Aortic Regurgitation

### Etiology

- Increased LVEDP (small, non-compliant LV)
- Pulmonary edema
- Reduced coronary perfusion (low diastolic pressure, high LVEDP)
- Cardiogenic shock
- Medical emergency requiring urgent intervention

**Chronic AR**:
- Progressive volume overload
- Compensatory mechanisms:
  - Eccentric LV hypertrophy (sarcomere replication in series)
  - LV dilatation (increases end-diastolic volume)
  - Increased total stroke volume (maintains forward output)
- Eventually, decompensation:
  - Irreversible LV dysfunction
  - Reduced EF
  - Heart failure symptoms

**Severity classification**:
- **Mild**: Regurgitant volume <30 mL/beat, regurgitant fraction <30%, EROA <0.10 cm²
- **Moderate**: Regurgitant volume 30-59 mL/beat, regurgitant fraction 30-49%, EROA 0.10-0.29 cm²

  - Best heard at left sternal border (or right sternal border if root dilatation)
  - Louder with patient sitting forward, end-expiration
  - Duration correlates with severity
- **Austin Flint murmur**:
  - Low-pitched mid-diastolic rumble at apex
  - Mitral leaflet vibration from AR jet
  - Mimics mitral stenosis
- **Systolic flow murmur**: Increased stroke volume through aortic valve
- **S3 gallop**: Volume overload, LV dysfunction
- **Widened pulse pressure**: Hyperdynamic circulation
  - Increased systolic BP (large stroke volume)
  - Decreased diastolic BP (runoff to LV)
- **Peripheral signs of severe AR**:
  - **Corrigan pulse** (water-hammer pulse): Bounding, rapid upstroke and collapse
  - **de Musset sign**: Head bobbing with heartbeat
  - **Quincke sign**: Capillary pulsations in nail beds

    - Severe if <200 ms (rapid equilibration)
  - **Regurgitant volume and fraction**: Quantitative measures
  - **EROA** (effective regurgitant orifice area): Severe if ≥0.30 cm²
  - **Vena contracta width**: Severe if ≥6 mm

- **Transthoracic vs. transesophageal**:

- Dilated ascending aorta
- Pulmonary congestion (if decompensated)

### Treatment

**Medical management**:

*Acute severe AR*:

  - Reduce BP if hypertensive
  - Serial imaging (echo every 6-12 months)
  - Avoid strenuous isometric exercise
- **No proven medical therapy to delay need for surgery** in normotensive patients

**Indications for surgery**:

*Class IIa*:
- Asymptomatic severe AR with LVESD 45-50 mm and low surgical risk
- Bicuspid valve with ascending aorta ≥55 mm (or ≥50 mm with risk factors)

**Surgical options**:
- **Aortic valve replacement**: Mechanical or bioprosthetic
- **Aortic valve repair**: Selected cases (prolapse, perforation)
- **Aortic root replacement**: If significant root dilatation (>45-50 mm)
  - Bentall procedure: Composite graft (valve + root)

**Outcomes**:
- Operative mortality: 3-5%
- Excellent outcomes if surgery before irreversible LV dysfunction
- Post-op LV function improvement: May take months, incomplete if severe pre-op dysfunction
- Long-term survival: Similar to age-matched population if timely intervention

## Mitral Stenosis

### Etiology

- >90% of cases
- Result of rheumatic fever (Group A Streptococcus pharyngitis)
- Latency period: 10-30 years after acute rheumatic fever
- Pathology:
  - Commissural fusion
  - Leaflet thickening and calcification
  - Chordal fusion and shortening
  - "Fish-mouth" or "buttonhole" orifice

**Non-rheumatic causes** (rare):
- Congenital mitral stenosis
- Severe mitral annular calcification (elderly)
- Carcinoid syndrome
- Systemic lupus erythematosus
- Rheumatoid arthritis
- Mucopolysaccharidoses

### Pathophysiology

**Hemodynamic consequences**:

- Pulmonary venous hypertension
- Pulmonary edema (LA pressure >25 mmHg)
- Reactive pulmonary arterial hypertension (chronic)
- RV pressure overload and failure
- Tricuspid regurgitation (annular dilatation)

**Severity classification**:
- **Mild**: Valve area >1.5 cm², mean gradient <5 mmHg
- **Moderate**: Valve area 1.0-1.5 cm², mean gradient 5-10 mmHg
- **Severe**: Valve area <1.0 cm², mean gradient >10 mmHg

**Factors increasing gradient**:

- **Chest pain**: Pulmonary hypertension, RV ischemia
- **Hoarseness** (Ortner syndrome): LA enlargement compressing recurrent laryngeal nerve
- **Thromboembolism**: Stroke, systemic emboli (especially with atrial fibrillation)

**Physical examination**:
- **Diastolic murmur**:
  - Low-pitched rumbling
  - Best heard at apex with bell, left lateral decubitus position
  - Presystolic accentuation (atrial contraction, absent in AF)
- **Opening snap**: Early diastole, after S2
  - High-pitched, heard at apex
  - S2-OS interval inversely related to severity (shorter = more severe)
- **Loud S1**: Abrupt closure of thickened, mobile leaflets
- **Accentuated P2**: Pulmonary hypertension
- **RV heave**: RV hypertrophy
- **Signs of RV failure**: Elevated JVP, peripheral edema, hepatomegaly, ascites

  - RV size and function
  - Pulmonary artery pressure

- **Doppler**:
  - **Mean gradient**: Severity assessment (mean >10 mmHg severe)
  - **Valve area** (planimetry or pressure half-time method): Most accurate
  - **Pulmonary artery systolic pressure**: From TR jet

- **Wilkins score** (valve morphology for percutaneous intervention):
  - Assesses leaflet mobility, thickening, calcification, subvalvular apparatus (each 1-4 points)
  - Score ≤8: Favorable for balloon valvuloplasty
  - Score >8: Less favorable, consider surgery

**ECG**:
- **P mitrale**: Broad, notched P wave in lead II (LA enlargement)
- **Atrial fibrillation**: Common
- **Right axis deviation**: RV hypertrophy
- **RV hypertrophy**: Tall R in V1, deep S in V5-V6

**Chest X-ray**:

  - Double density sign (LA behind RA)
  - Elevated left main bronchus
- **Pulmonary venous congestion**: Cephalization, Kerley B lines
- **Pulmonary artery enlargement**: Prominent main PA

- **Atrial fibrillation management**:
  - Rate control (target <80-100 bpm)
  - Anticoagulation (all patients with AF, even if paroxysmal)
- **Anticoagulation**: For AF, prior embolism, LA thrombus
- **Endocarditis prophylaxis**: No longer recommended (2007 guidelines change)
- **Treat precipitants**: Anemia, infection, thyrotoxicosis

**Percutaneous mitral balloon commissurotomy (PMBC)**:

*Indications*:
- Symptomatic moderate-severe MS (valve area <1.5 cm²)
- Favorable valve morphology (Wilkins score ≤8)
- No LA thrombus (TEE to exclude)
- No or mild (1+) mitral regurgitation

*Technique*:
- Transseptal puncture
- Balloon inflation across mitral valve
- Splits fused commissures

*Outcomes*:
- Immediate increase in valve area to 1.5-2.0 cm²
- Symptom improvement in >90%
- 10-year event-free survival: 50-70%
- Restenosis rate: 10-20% at 10 years

*Complications*:
- Mitral regurgitation (severe in 2-10%)
- ASD (from transseptal puncture, usually small)
- Stroke (rare with TEE to exclude thrombus)
- Cardiac tamponade
- Mortality: <1%

**Surgical mitral valve repair/replacement**:

*Indications*:
- Symptomatic severe MS not suitable for PMBC (calcified, MR >2+, thrombus)
- Failed PMBC
- Concomitant moderate-severe MR
- Other indications for cardiac surgery (CAD, aortic valve)

*Open commissurotomy*:
- Surgical division of fused commissures
- Preferred if valve suitable for repair

*Mitral valve replacement*:
- Heavily calcified or regurgitant valve
- Bioprosthetic vs. mechanical (same considerations as AVR)

*Outcomes*:
- Operative mortality: 3-10% (higher with pulmonary hypertension, RV dysfunction)
- Long-term survival depends on pre-op functional class and pulmonary pressures

## Mitral Regurgitation

### Etiology

**Primary (organic) MR** (valve abnormality):
- **Degenerative** (most common in developed countries):
  - Mitral valve prolapse (myxomatous degeneration)
  - Fibroelastic deficiency
  - Chordal rupture
- **Rheumatic heart disease**: Leaflet retraction, commissural fusion
- **Infective endocarditis**: Leaflet perforation, vegetation, chordal rupture
- **Congenital**: Cleft mitral valve, AV canal defects
- **Connective tissue disorders**: Marfan, Ehlers-Danlos
- **Radiation**
- **Drugs**: Ergot derivatives, appetite suppressants

**Secondary (functional) MR** (structurally normal valve):
- **Ischemic**: Papillary muscle dysfunction, LV remodeling
  - Inferior MI: Posteromedial papillary muscle (single blood supply from PDA)
  - Acute rupture → severe acute MR, cardiogenic shock
- **Dilated cardiomyopathy**: Annular dilatation, leaflet tethering
- **Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy**: SAM (systolic anterior motion), LV outflow obstruction

### Pathophysiology

**Acute severe MR**:
- Sudden volume load on unprepared LA and LV
- LA not dilated → markedly elevated LA pressure
- Pulmonary edema
- Reduced forward cardiac output
- Hypotension, cardiogenic shock
- Medical/surgical emergency

**Chronic MR**:
- Progressive volume overload
- Compensatory mechanisms:
  - LA dilatation (accommodates regurgitant volume)
  - LV dilatation (eccentric hypertrophy)
  - Increased total stroke volume
- "Double outlet" LV (forward output + regurgitant volume)
- Reduced afterload (LV ejects to low-pressure LA)
- Maintains EF until late disease
- Eventually:
  - Irreversible LV dysfunction
  - Atrial fibrillation (LA enlargement)
  - Pulmonary hypertension
  - RV failure

**Severity classification**:
- **Mild**: Regurgitant volume <30 mL/beat, regurgitant fraction <30%, EROA <0.20 cm²
- **Moderate**: Regurgitant volume 30-59 mL/beat, regurgitant fraction 30-49%, EROA 0.20-0.39 cm²
- **Severe**: Regurgitant volume ≥60 mL/beat, regurgitant fraction ≥50%, EROA ≥0.40 cm²

### Clinical Presentation

**Acute severe MR**:

**Chronic MR**:
- **Asymptomatic period**: Years (compensated phase)
- **Symptoms** (decompensation):
  - Dyspnea, fatigue, exercise intolerance
  - Orthopnea, PND
  - Palpitations (atrial fibrillation)
  - Right heart failure symptoms (late)

**Physical examination**:
- **Holosystolic murmur**:
  - High-pitched, blowing
  - Best heard at apex
  - Radiates to axilla (posterior leaflet) or left sternal border (anterior leaflet)
  - Intensity does not correlate with severity
- **S3 gallop**: Volume overload
- **Hyperdynamic, displaced apical impulse**: LV dilatation
- **Soft S1**: Incomplete leaflet coaptation
- **Wide splitting of S2**: Early aortic closure (reduced afterload)
- **Mid-diastolic flow rumble**: Increased flow across mitral valve (severe MR)

### Diagnosis

**Echocardiography**:

  - Valve morphology (prolapse, flail, vegetation, rheumatic)
  - Mechanism: Prolapse, flail leaflet, restricted motion, perforation
  - LA and LV size
  - LV systolic function
  - RV function, pulmonary pressures

- **Doppler**:

  - **Regurgitant volume and fraction**: Quantitative assessment
  - **EROA**: Severe if ≥0.40 cm² (primary MR) or ≥0.20 cm² (secondary MR)
  - **Systolic pulmonary vein flow reversal**: Severe MR

- **TEE**:
  - Superior for valve morphology and mechanism
  - Intraoperative guidance for repair
  - 3D TEE: Surgical planning

**Cardiac MRI**:
- Accurate quantification of regurgitant volume
- LV volumes and function
- Useful if echo inadequate

**Cardiac catheterization**:
- LV angiography: Qualitative assessment (1-4+ scale)
- Assess for CAD pre-operatively
- Hemodynamics: Elevated PCWP with V waves

**ECG**:
- LA enlargement (P mitrale)
- LV hypertrophy (volume overload pattern)
- Atrial fibrillation

**Chest X-ray**:

- Diuretics: Pulmonary edema
- Intra-aortic balloon pump: Temporizing measure
- **Urgent surgery**: Definitive treatment

*Chronic primary MR*:
- **Asymptomatic with preserved LV function**: Observation, serial echo
- **Symptomatic**: Vasodilators (ACE inhibitors) may provide symptomatic relief but do not delay surgery
- **Atrial fibrillation**: Rate control, anticoagulation
- **Heart failure**: Diuretics, ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers

*Chronic secondary MR*:
- **Optimize medical therapy for underlying disease** (HFrEF, ischemic heart disease)
- GDMT for heart failure: ACE inhibitors/ARBs/ARNI, beta-blockers, MRAs
- CRT if indicated (may reduce MR)

**Indications for intervention** (ACC/AHA Guidelines):

*Primary MR*:

*Class I*:
- **Symptomatic** severe MR
- **Asymptomatic** severe MR with:
  - LV dysfunction (LVEF 30-60% or LVESD ≥40 mm)
  - Atrial fibrillation
  - Pulmonary hypertension (PASP >50 mmHg)
  - Undergoing other cardiac surgery

*Class IIa*:
- Asymptomatic severe MR with preserved LV function if:
  - High likelihood of successful repair
  - Low surgical risk
  - Flail leaflet and LVESD ≥40 mm

*Secondary MR*:
- Consider intervention if severe, symptomatic despite optimal medical therapy and CRT
- Revascularization if ischemic etiology
- Repair vs. replacement controversial (higher recurrence with repair)

**Surgical mitral valve repair**:

*Techniques*:
- **Quadrangular resection**: Excise prolapsing segment (posterior leaflet)
- **Chordal transfer or replacement**: Artificial chordae
- **Annuloplasty ring**: Remodel and stabilize annulus
- **Edge-to-edge repair** (Alfieri stitch): Suture leaflets together

*Advantages over replacement*:
- Preserves LV geometry and function
- Better long-term outcomes
- No anticoagulation required (unless AF)
- Lower operative mortality

*Outcomes*:
- Success rate: >95% in experienced centers for degenerative MR
- Reoperation rate: 5-10% at 10 years
- Excellent long-term durability

**Mitral valve replacement**:
- When repair not feasible (calcified, rheumatic, endocarditis with destruction)
- Bioprosthetic vs. mechanical valve (same considerations as AVR)
- Preserve chordae if possible (maintains LV geometry)

**Transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (MitraClip)**:

*Indications*:
- Symptomatic severe primary MR with:
  - Prohibitive or high surgical risk
  - Favorable anatomy (central jet, adequate leaflet length)
- Symptomatic severe secondary MR despite optimal medical therapy

*Technique*:
- Transseptal approach
- Clip grasps anterior and posterior leaflets (edge-to-edge)
- Creates double-orifice valve

*Outcomes*:
- Primary MR (EVEREST II): Less effective than surgery but lower morbidity
- Secondary MR (COAPT trial): Reduced HF hospitalization and mortality vs. medical therapy alone
- Improvement in symptoms and quality of life

*Complications*:
- Residual MR
- Mitral stenosis (if multiple clips)
- Single-leaflet detachment
- Bleeding, vascular complications

## Tricuspid and Pulmonary Valve Disease

### Tricuspid Regurgitation

**Etiology**:
- **Secondary (functional)**: >90% of cases
  - RV dilatation from pulmonary hypertension (left heart disease, lung disease)
  - Annular dilatation
- **Primary**:
  - Endocarditis (IV drug use): Vegetation, perforation, chordal rupture
  - Rheumatic (usually with mitral and aortic)
  - Carcinoid syndrome (plaque-like thickening)
  - Pacemaker/ICD lead-induced
  - Trauma (endomyocardial biopsy, chest trauma)
  - Ebstein anomaly (congenital)

**Clinical presentation**:
- Often asymptomatic
- RV failure: Peripheral edema, ascites, hepatomegaly
- Pulsatile liver (severe TR)
- Holosystolic murmur at left lower sternal border (increases with inspiration, Carvallo sign)

**Treatment**:
- **Functional TR**: Treat underlying cause (left heart disease, pulmonary hypertension)
- **Severe TR**: Surgical repair or replacement at time of left-sided valve surgery
- **Isolated severe TR**: Consider surgery if symptomatic despite medical therapy

### Tricuspid Stenosis

**Etiology**:
- Rheumatic (almost always with mitral stenosis)
- Carcinoid syndrome
- Congenital

**Clinical presentation**:
- Symptoms of right heart failure
- Diastolic murmur at left lower sternal border (increases with inspiration)
- Elevated JVP with prominent A wave

**Treatment**:
- Usually surgical at time of other valve surgery
- Balloon valvuloplasty rarely performed

### Pulmonary Stenosis

**Etiology**:
- Congenital (most common): Valvular, subvalvular, supravalvular
- Carcinoid syndrome
- Rheumatic (rare)

**Clinical presentation**:
- Often asymptomatic if mild-moderate
- Severe: Dyspnea, fatigue, syncope, RV failure
- Systolic ejection murmur at left upper sternal border

**Treatment**:
- Balloon valvuloplasty: First-line for valvular PS
- Surgery: Subvalvular or supravalvular PS

### Pulmonary Regurgitation

**Etiology**:
- **Secondary**: Pulmonary hypertension (most common)
- **Primary**: Post-surgical (TOF repair), endocarditis, congenital

**Clinical presentation**:
- Usually well-tolerated
- Severe chronic PR: RV dilatation, failure
- Graham Steell murmur: High-pitched diastolic murmur (pulmonary hypertension)

**Treatment**:
- Treat underlying pulmonary hypertension
- Pulmonary valve replacement if severe, symptomatic

## Prosthetic Valves

### Types

**Mechanical valves**:
- Bileaflet (St. Jude, ATS): Most common
- Tilting disk (Medtronic Hall): Less common now
- Ball-cage (Starr-Edwards): Rarely used, durable

**Bioprosthetic valves**:
- Stented (Carpentier-Edwards, Hancock)
- Stentless
- Homograft (cadaveric)
- Autograft (Ross procedure: pulmonary valve to aortic position)

### Anticoagulation

**Mechanical valves**:
- **Lifelong warfarin** required
- Target INR based on valve type and position:
  - Aortic: INR 2-3 (bileaflet or tilting disk)
  - Mitral: INR 2.5-3.5 (any mechanical valve)
  - Additional risk factors: INR 2.5-3.5
- Add aspirin 75-100 mg if CAD, stroke, or vascular disease

**Bioprosthetic valves**:
- Warfarin for 3-6 months post-op (or lifelong if AF, prior thromboembolism)
- Then aspirin alone if no other indication

**DOACs**:
- Not recommended for mechanical valves (RE-ALIGN trial: increased thrombosis and bleeding)
- May be considered for bioprosthetic valves and AF (based on CHA2DS2-VASc)

### Complications

**Structural valve deterioration (SVD)**:
- Bioprosthetic: 10-15 years median durability
  - Faster in younger patients, mitral position, renal failure
  - Calcification, leaflet tear, stenosis or regurgitation
- Mechanical: Rare, usually from pannus overgrowth

**Prosthetic valve thrombosis**:
- Mechanical > bioprosthetic
- Risk factors: Subtherapeutic INR, AF, low flow states
- Presentation: Acute (obstructive) or chronic
- Diagnosis: TTE/TEE (reduced leaflet motion, thrombus, elevated gradients)
- Treatment:
  - Hemodynamically stable, small thrombus: IV heparin, optimize anticoagulation
  - Hemodynamically unstable or large thrombus: Thrombolysis (alteplase) vs. urgent surgery

**Prosthetic valve endocarditis (PVE)**:
- **Early** (<1 year): Nosocomial, S. aureus, S. epidermidis (highest risk first 6 months)
- **Late** (>1 year): Similar organisms to native valve endocarditis
- Higher mortality than native valve endocarditis
- Treatment: Prolonged antibiotics (4-6 weeks), surgery often required

**Paravalvular leak (PVL)**:
- Gap between prosthesis and annulus
- Causes: Endocarditis, calcification, suture dehiscence
- Mild PVL: Common, often clinically insignificant
- Severe PVL: Hemolysis, heart failure
- Treatment: Percutaneous closure vs. surgical repair

**Hemolysis**:
- Mechanical valves (especially older models)
- Paravalvular leak
- Mild chronic hemolysis: Common, compensated
- Severe: Anemia, iron deficiency, LDH elevation, low haptoglobin
- Treatment: Iron supplementation, reduce severity if possible, consider replacement if severe

**Patient-prosthesis mismatch**:
- Effective orifice area of prosthesis too small for patient's body size
- Results in residual gradient
- Prevention: Choose appropriate size valve at surgery
- Severe mismatch may require reoperation

### Follow-up

**Surveillance echocardiography**:
- Baseline TTE post-op (discharge or 1 month)
- Annual TTE if symptoms or abnormal exam
- Routine surveillance for bioprosthetic valves at 5 years, then annually after 10 years

**Anticoagulation monitoring**:
- INR monitoring for mechanical valves (monthly if stable, more frequently if unstable)
- Educate patients on dietary interactions, medication interactions

**Endocarditis prophylaxis**:
- All prosthetic valves (mechanical and bioprosthetic)
- Dental procedures with manipulation of gingival tissue or periapical region
- Respiratory tract procedures involving incision
- Amoxicillin 2 g PO 30-60 min before procedure (or clindamycin if penicillin allergy)

## Key Points

- Aortic stenosis is the most common valvular disease; severe symptomatic AS requires intervention (SAVR or TAVR)
- Aortic regurgitation causes volume overload with eccentric LVH; surgery indicated once symptoms or LV dysfunction develops
- Mitral stenosis is predominantly rheumatic in etiology; percutaneous balloon valvuloplasty is first-line if suitable anatomy
- Mitral regurgitation may be primary (valve abnormality) or secondary (functional); repair preferred over replacement for primary MR
- Echocardiography is the primary diagnostic modality for valvular heart disease assessment
- Timing of intervention is critical to prevent irreversible myocardial dysfunction
- Mechanical valves require lifelong anticoagulation but offer durability; bioprosthetic valves avoid anticoagulation but have limited lifespan
- Transcatheter interventions (TAVR, MitraClip) are established alternatives for high-risk surgical patients
