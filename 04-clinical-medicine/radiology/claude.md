# Radiology

## Directory Overview

This directory contains comprehensive educational content on clinical radiology, covering essential imaging modalities, interpretation principles, and key findings across major body systems. The focus is on practical application for clinicians ordering and interpreting imaging studies.

## Completion Status

**Phase 1: Complete** ✓

All core radiology topics have been completed with comprehensive clinical content focused on practical interpretation and clinical applications.

## Contents

### Thoracic Imaging
1. **chest-imaging.md** - Chest X-ray and CT interpretation, common thoracic pathologies

### Abdominal and Pelvic Imaging
2. **abdominal-imaging.md** - Abdominal imaging modalities, organ-specific findings, acute abdomen

### Neurological Imaging
3. **neuroimaging.md** - Brain and spine imaging, stroke, trauma, tumors, degenerative disease

### Musculoskeletal Imaging
4. **musculoskeletal-imaging.md** - Plain films, MRI, CT for bones, joints, and soft tissues

### Interventional Procedures
5. **interventional-radiology.md** - Image-guided procedures, therapeutic interventions

## File Specifications

Each file contains:
- **YAML frontmatter** with title, order, and category
- **Comprehensive content** (600-700 lines each)
- **Structured sections**: Imaging techniques, anatomy, pathology, interpretation
- **Systematic approach**: Step-by-step interpretation methods
- **Clinical correlation**: When to order, what to look for, clinical implications

## Learning Objectives

After studying this directory, learners should be able to:

1. **Chest Imaging**
   - Systematically interpret chest X-rays
   - Recognize common thoracic pathologies
   - Understand indications for CT chest
   - Identify pneumonia, pneumothorax, pleural effusions, masses

2. **Abdominal Imaging**
   - Choose appropriate imaging for clinical scenarios
   - Recognize acute abdominal conditions
   - Interpret common findings on CT abdomen
   - Understand bowel obstruction, appendicitis, cholecystitis patterns

3. **Neuroimaging**
   - Differentiate CT vs MRI indications
   - Recognize acute stroke on imaging
   - Identify traumatic brain injuries
   - Understand spine imaging for common pathologies

4. **Musculoskeletal Imaging**
   - Interpret plain radiographs for fractures
   - Understand MRI for ligament and tendon injuries
   - Recognize arthritis patterns
   - Identify bone tumors and infections

5. **Interventional Radiology**
   - Understand common IR procedures
   - Know indications for IR interventions
   - Recognize complications
   - Appreciate IR role in multidisciplinary care

## Integration with Other Specialties

Radiology interfaces with:
- **Emergency Medicine**: Trauma, acute abdomen, stroke protocols
- **Internal Medicine**: Pneumonia, CHF, masses, staging
- **Surgery**: Pre-operative planning, post-operative complications
- **Oncology**: Staging, response assessment
- **Neurology**: Stroke, MS, degenerative disease
- **Orthopedics**: Fractures, arthritis, sports injuries

## Imaging Modalities Covered

- **Plain Radiography (X-ray)**: Chest, abdomen, skeletal

## Systematic Interpretation Emphasized

Each file teaches systematic approach:
1. Confirm patient identification and exam
2. Assess technical adequacy
3. Systematic review of all structures
4. Identify abnormalities
5. Formulate differential diagnosis
6. Correlate with clinical presentation
7. Recommend further imaging if needed

## Radiation Safety

- Understanding radiation doses
- ALARA principles (As Low As Reasonably Achievable)
- Appropriate test selection
- Special populations (pregnancy, pediatrics)
- Contrast safety and contraindications

## Clinical Decision Making

- When to order imaging vs observe
- Choosing the right modality for the question
- Urgent vs routine imaging
- Cost-effectiveness considerations
- Evidence-based imaging guidelines

## Common Pitfalls and Pearls

Each file includes:
- Common interpretation errors
- Normal variants vs pathology
- Technical factors affecting interpretation
- When to call for expert consultation
- Correlating imaging with clinical context

## Evidence-Based Guidelines Referenced

- American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria
- ACR-SPR Practice Parameters
- Fleischner Society guidelines (pulmonary nodules)
- NASCET criteria (carotid stenosis)
- RECIST criteria (tumor response)

## Next Steps

This directory is complete. Learners should:
1. Study each file systematically
2. Practice image interpretation with cases
