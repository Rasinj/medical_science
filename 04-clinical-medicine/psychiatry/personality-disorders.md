# Personality Disorders

## Overview

Personality disorders are enduring patterns of inner experience and behavior that deviate markedly from cultural expectations, are pervasive and inflexible, begin by early adulthood, are stable over time, and lead to distress or impairment. These disorders affect how individuals think about themselves and others, emotional responses, interpersonal functioning, and impulse control, causing significant problems in relationships, work, and social functioning.

### Definition of Personality
- **Personality**: Enduring patterns of thinking, feeling, and behaving
- **Personality traits**: Consistent ways of perceiving and relating to environment and self

### General Criteria for Personality Disorders
A. Enduring pattern deviating from cultural expectations in ≥2 areas:
   1. Cognition (ways of perceiving self, others, events)
   2. Affectivity (range, intensity, lability of emotional response)
   3. Interpersonal functioning
   4. Impulse control

B. Pattern is inflexible and pervasive across contexts
C. Leads to clinically significant distress or impairment
D. Pattern is stable and long duration, onset traced to adolescence or early adulthood
E. Not better explained by another mental disorder
F. Not due to physiological effects of substance or medical condition
