# Substance Use Disorders

## Overview

Substance use disorders (SUDs) are complex medical conditions characterized by the recurrent use of alcohol or drugs despite significant substance-related problems and functional impairment. These disorders represent a spectrum from mild to severe, involving changes in brain circuits responsible for reward, stress, and self-control. SUDs are among the most common and costly public health problems, affecting millions of people worldwide and contributing to significant morbidity, mortality, and socioeconomic burden.

### Definition and Terminology
- **Substance use disorder**: Problematic pattern of substance use leading to impairment or distress
- **Addiction**: Chronic, relapsing disorder characterized by compulsive drug seeking and use
- **Tolerance**: Need for increased amounts to achieve desired effect
- **Withdrawal**: Characteristic syndrome when substance use is reduced or stopped
- **Craving**: Intense desire or urge to use substances

### Epidemiology
- **Prevalence**: 10-15% lifetime prevalence of substance use disorders
- **Economic burden**: >$400 billion annually in healthcare, crime, and lost productivity
- **Leading causes**: Alcohol (most common), followed by cannabis, cocaine, opioids
- **Demographics**: Higher rates in males, young adults, certain ethnic groups
- **Comorbidity**: High rates of co-occurring mental health disorders

### Classification (DSM-5)
- **Alcohol use disorder**: Problematic alcohol use
- **Tobacco use disorder**: Problematic tobacco use
- **Cannabis use disorder**: Problematic cannabis use
- **Stimulant use disorder**: Cocaine, amphetamines
- **Hallucinogen use disorder**: LSD, PCP, MDMA
- **Opioid use disorder**: Heroin, prescription opioids
- **Sedative use disorder**: Benzodiazepines, barbiturates
- **Inhalant use disorder**: Volatile substances

### Severity Specifiers
- **Mild**: 2-3 criteria present
- **Moderate**: 4-5 criteria present
- **Severe**: 6+ criteria present

## Pathophysiology

### Neurobiology of Addiction

#### Reward Pathway
- **Mesolimbic dopamine system**: Primary reward circuit
- **Ventral tegmental area (VTA)**: Dopamine-producing neurons
- **Nucleus accumbens**: Primary target, "pleasure center"
- **Prefrontal cortex**: Executive function, decision-making
- **Dopamine release**: All drugs of abuse increase dopamine in nucleus accumbens

#### Neuroadaptation
- **Tolerance**: Reduced response to repeated drug exposure
- **Sensitization**: Enhanced response to drug-associated cues
- **Neuroplasticity**: Long-term changes in brain structure and function
- **Allostasis**: New "set point" requiring drugs for normal function

### Three-Stage Model of Addiction

#### Stage 1: Binge/Intoxication
- **Acute reinforcement**: Positive reinforcing effects of drugs
- **Dopamine surge**: Massive release in reward circuits
- **Learning**: Association between drug use and pleasure
- **Impulsivity**: Immediate gratification seeking

#### Stage 2: Withdrawal/Negative Affect
- **Negative reinforcement**: Drug use to avoid withdrawal
- **Stress systems**: Dysregulated HPA axis, CRF
- **Anhedonia**: Inability to experience pleasure without drugs
- **Emotional dysregulation**: Anxiety, depression, irritability

#### Stage 3: Preoccupation/Anticipation
- **Craving**: Intense urges triggered by cues
- **Executive dysfunction**: Impaired decision-making, impulse control
- **Cognitive bias**: Attention focused on drug-related stimuli
- **Compulsivity**: Loss of control over drug use

### Genetic Factors
- **Heritability**: 40-60% for most substance use disorders
- **Twin studies**: Genetic vulnerability to addiction
- **Candidate genes**: ADH, ALDH (alcohol), COMT, DAT1 (dopamine)
- **Genome-wide association studies**: Multiple risk variants identified
- **Gene-environment interaction**: Genetic risk + environmental triggers

### Environmental Factors
- **Early life stress**: Trauma, abuse, neglect increase risk
- **Peer influence**: Social learning, drug availability
- **Cultural factors**: Attitudes toward substance use
- **Socioeconomic status**: Poverty, unemployment, lack of opportunity
- **Accessibility**: Availability and cost of substances

## Key Points

- Substance use disorders are chronic, complex medical conditions involving changes in brain reward, stress, and self-control circuits
- The DSM-5 uses a dimensional approach with mild, moderate, and severe specifiers based on number of criteria met
- All drugs of abuse increase dopamine in the nucleus accumbens, the brain's primary reward center
- Alcohol withdrawal can be life-threatening and requires medical supervision with benzodiazepines
- Medication-assisted treatment (methadone, buprenorphine, naltrexone) is highly effective for opioid use disorder
- Psychosocial interventions like CBT, motivational interviewing, and contingency management are evidence-based treatments
- Co-occurring mental health disorders are very common and require integrated treatment
- Recovery is possible with appropriate treatment, but relapse rates are high and ongoing support is essential
- Prevention efforts include education, policy changes, screening, and early intervention
- Treatment should be individualized and address the whole person, not just the substance use
