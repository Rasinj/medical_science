# Anxiety Disorders

## Overview

Anxiety disorders are among the most common mental health conditions, characterized by excessive fear, anxiety, and related behavioral disturbances that significantly impair functioning. While anxiety is a normal adaptive response to threat, anxiety disorders involve disproportionate, persistent, and debilitating symptoms that interfere with daily life, relationships, and occupational functioning.

### Definition and Normal vs. Pathological Anxiety
- **Normal anxiety**: Adaptive response to real threats, proportionate to situation
- **Pathological anxiety**: Excessive, persistent, interferes with functioning
- **Fear**: Emotional response to immediate, real threat
- **Anxiety**: Anticipation of future threat or perceived danger

### Epidemiology
- **Prevalence**: Most common class of psychiatric disorders
- **Lifetime prevalence**: 25-30% of population
- **12-month prevalence**: 15-20% of adults
- **Gender differences**: More common in women (2:1 ratio)
- **Age of onset**: Often begins in childhood or adolescence
- **Comorbidity**: High rates of comorbid mood and substance use disorders

### Classification (DSM-5)
- **Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD)**: Excessive worry about multiple areas
- **Panic disorder**: Recurrent panic attacks with persistent concern
- **Specific phobias**: Excessive fear of specific objects or situations
- **Social anxiety disorder**: Fear of social situations and scrutiny
- **Agoraphobia**: Fear of situations where escape might be difficult
- **Separation anxiety disorder**: Excessive anxiety about separation
- **Selective mutism**: Consistent failure to speak in specific situations

## Pathophysiology

### Neurobiological Mechanisms

#### Fear Circuitry
- **Amygdala**: Central fear processing center, threat detection
- **Hippocampus**: Memory formation, context processing
- **Prefrontal cortex**: Executive control, fear extinction
- **Anterior cingulate cortex**: Emotional regulation, conflict monitoring
- **Insula**: Interoceptive awareness, emotional processing

#### Neurotransmitter Systems

##### GABA System
- **Primary inhibitory neurotransmitter**: Reduces neuronal excitability
- **GABA-A receptors**: Fast synaptic inhibition
- **Benzodiazepines**: Enhance GABA function
- **Dysfunction**: Reduced GABAergic inhibition in anxiety

##### Serotonin System
- **5-HT1A receptors**: Anxiolytic effects when activated
- **5-HT2A/2C receptors**: Anxiogenic effects
- **SSRIs**: Increase serotonin availability
- **Raphe nuclei**: Primary serotonin-producing regions

##### Norepinephrine System
- **Locus coeruleus**: Primary norepinephrine center
- **Sympathetic activation**: Fight-or-flight response
- **Hyperactivity**: Associated with anxiety symptoms
- **Beta-blockers**: Reduce peripheral sympathetic symptoms

#### HPA Axis
- **Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis**: Stress response system
- **Cortisol**: Primary stress hormone
- **Dysregulation**: Altered cortisol patterns in anxiety disorders

### Genetic Factors
- **Heritability**: 30-40% for most anxiety disorders
- **Twin studies**: Genetic vulnerability to anxiety
