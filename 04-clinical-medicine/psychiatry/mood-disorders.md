# Mood Disorders

## Overview

Mood disorders are psychiatric conditions characterized by disturbances in emotional regulation that significantly impair functioning and quality of life. They represent some of the most common and disabling mental health conditions worldwide, affecting millions of people across all demographics. The two primary categories are depressive disorders and bipolar disorders, each with distinct clinical presentations, courses, and treatment approaches.

### Epidemiology
- **Major depressive disorder**: Lifetime prevalence 10-15%, 12-month prevalence 5-9%
- **Bipolar disorder**: Lifetime prevalence 1-2%, equal gender distribution
- **Gender differences**: Depression more common in women (2:1 ratio)
- **Age of onset**: Typically late teens to early adulthood
- **Economic burden**: Leading cause of disability worldwide

### Classification (DSM-5)
- **Depressive disorders**: Major depressive disorder, persistent depressive disorder, premenstrual dysphoric disorder
- **Bipolar and related disorders**: Bipolar I, bipolar II, cyclothymic disorder
- **Substance/medication-induced**: Due to intoxication or withdrawal
- **Due to medical condition**: Secondary to general medical condition

## Pathophysiology

### Neurobiological Mechanisms

#### Neurotransmitter Systems
- **Monoamine hypothesis**: Deficiency in serotonin, norepinephrine, dopamine
- **Serotonin (5-HT)**: Mood regulation, sleep, appetite, cognitive function
- **Norepinephrine (NE)**: Arousal, attention, motivation, energy
- **Dopamine (DA)**: Reward, motivation, psychomotor activity
- **GABA**: Inhibitory neurotransmitter, anxiety regulation

#### Neuroplasticity and Stress
- **Stress hypothesis**: Chronic stress leads to neurobiological changes
- **HPA axis dysregulation**: Hyperactivity of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis
- **Neurotropic factors**: Reduced BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor)
- **Neurogenesis**: Impaired hippocampal neurogenesis
- **Synaptic plasticity**: Altered synaptic connectivity

#### Circadian Rhythms
- **Sleep-wake cycles**: Disrupted circadian rhythms
- **Melatonin**: Abnormal melatonin secretion patterns
- **REM sleep**: Altered REM sleep architecture
- **Seasonal patterns**: Light exposure and mood regulation

### Genetic Factors
- **Heritability**: 30-40% for depression, 60-80% for bipolar disorder
- **Polygenic inheritance**: Multiple genes with small effects
- **Gene-environment interaction**: Genetic vulnerability + environmental stressors
- **Candidate genes**: Serotonin transporter (5-HTTLPR), COMT, BDNF

### Environmental Factors
- **Early life stress**: Childhood trauma, abuse, neglect
- **Life events**: Loss, relationship problems, financial stress
- **Chronic stress**: Ongoing psychosocial stressors
- **Social support**: Protective factor against mood disorders

## Major Depressive Disorder
