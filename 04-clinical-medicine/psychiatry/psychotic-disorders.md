# Psychotic Disorders

## Overview

Psychotic disorders are a group of severe mental health conditions characterized by distortions in thinking, perception, emotions, language, sense of self, and behavior. The hallmark features include psychotic symptoms such as delusions, hallucinations, disorganized thinking, and abnormal motor behavior. These disorders significantly impair functioning and quality of life, often requiring long-term treatment and support.

### Definition of Psychosis
- **Psychosis**: Loss of contact with reality
- **Core symptoms**: Delusions, hallucinations, disorganized thinking, abnormal motor behavior
- **Reality testing**: Impaired ability to distinguish internal experiences from external reality
- **Functioning**: Significant impairment in social, occupational, or interpersonal areas

### Epidemiology
- **Schizophrenia**: Lifetime prevalence ~1%, equal gender distribution
- **Brief psychotic disorder**: Rare, more common in women
- **Delusional disorder**: Prevalence 0.2%, slight female predominance
- **Age of onset**: Typically late teens to early thirties
- **Economic burden**: High healthcare costs, disability, lost productivity

### Classification (DSM-5)
- **Schizophrenia spectrum disorders**: Schizophrenia, brief psychotic disorder, schizophreniform disorder
- **Other psychotic disorders**: Delusional disorder, substance-induced, due to medical condition
- **Related disorders**: Schizoaffective disorder, schizotypal personality disorder

## Pathophysiology

### Neurotransmitter Systems

#### Dopamine Hypothesis
- **Hyperactivity**: Increased dopamine activity in mesolimbic pathway
- **Hypoactivity**: Decreased dopamine in mesocortical pathway
- **D2 receptors**: Primary target of antipsychotic medications
- **Four dopamine pathways**:
  - **Mesolimbic**: Ventral tegmental area to limbic structures (positive symptoms)
  - **Mesocortical**: VTA to prefrontal cortex (negative symptoms, cognition)
  - **Nigrostriatal**: Substantia nigra to striatum (movement)
  - **Tuberoinfundibular**: Hypothalamus to pituitary (prolactin)

#### Glutamate Hypothesis
- **NMDA receptor hypofunction**: Reduced glutamate signaling
- **Downstream effects**: Altered GABA and dopamine function
- **Cognitive symptoms**: Executive dysfunction, memory impairment
- **Developmental aspect**: Abnormal synaptic pruning

#### Other Neurotransmitters
- **GABA**: Inhibitory dysfunction, parvalbumin interneuron deficits
- **Acetylcholine**: Nicotinic receptor dysfunction, cognitive symptoms
- **Serotonin**: 5-HT2A receptors, hallucinogenic effects

### Neuroanatomical Changes

#### Structural Abnormalities
- **Ventricular enlargement**: Increased lateral and third ventricle size
- **Gray matter reduction**: Frontal and temporal cortex, hippocampus
- **White matter abnormalities**: Reduced connectivity between regions
- **Progressive changes**: Some structural changes worsen over time

#### Functional Abnormalities
- **Hypofrontality**: Reduced prefrontal cortex activity
- **Default mode network**: Altered connectivity patterns
- **Gamma oscillations**: Disrupted neural synchrony
- **Cerebral blood flow**: Regional perfusion abnormalities

### Genetic Factors
- **Heritability**: 60-80% for schizophrenia
- **Polygenic inheritance**: Multiple genes with small effects
- **Rare variants**: Copy number variations, de novo mutations
- **Candidate genes**: DISC1, NRG1, COMT, CACNA1C
- **Genome-wide association studies**: 100+ risk loci identified

### Environmental Factors
- **Prenatal infections**: Maternal influenza, toxoplasmosis
- **Obstetric complications**: Hypoxia, low birth weight
- **Urban birth**: Increased risk in urban environments
- **Migration**: Higher rates in immigrant populations
- **Cannabis use**: Particularly high-potency THC
- **Psychosocial stress**: Trauma, adversity, social defeat

### Neurodevelopmental Model
- **Early brain development**: Abnormal neuronal migration, synaptogenesis
- **Adolescent brain maturation**: Synaptic pruning, myelination
- **Two-hit hypothesis**: Early vulnerability + later environmental trigger
- **Progressive illness**: Continued deterioration after onset
