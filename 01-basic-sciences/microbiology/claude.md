# Microbiology

## Overview
Study of microorganisms including bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites. Focuses on microbial structure, pathogenesis, host-pathogen interactions, antimicrobial agents, and disease prevention. Essential foundation for infectious disease diagnosis and treatment.

**Content Status**: Complete coverage of all major microbiology domains
**Quality Features**: Comprehensive mechanisms, clinical correlations, antimicrobial therapy
**Last Updated**: January 2025
