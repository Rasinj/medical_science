# Connective Tissue

## Introduction

Connective tissue is the most abundant and widely distributed tissue type in the body. It provides structural and metabolic support for other tissues and organs. Unlike epithelium, connective tissue is characterized by abundant extracellular matrix (ECM) with relatively sparse cells.

### Learning Objectives

1. Understand the composition and organization of connective tissue
2. Classify connective tissue types and identify them microscopically
3. Describe the structure and function of ECM components
4. Recognize specialized connective tissues (cartilage, bone, blood)
5. Correlate connective tissue structure with function
6. Recognize clinical disorders of connective tissue

## General Characteristics

**Defining Features:**
- **Abundant extracellular matrix (ECM)**: Cells widely separated
- **Vascularized**: Well-supplied with blood vessels (exception: cartilage)
- **Innervated**: Contains sensory nerve endings
- **Mesodermal origin**: Develops from mesenchyme (embryonic connective tissue)

**Functions:**
- **Structural support**: Framework for organs
- **Protection**: Cushions organs (adipose), protects (bone)
- **Binding and connecting**: Holds tissues together
- **Transport**: Blood carries nutrients, wastes, gases
- **Storage**: Fat (adipose), minerals (bone)
- **Defense**: Immune cells (macrophages, mast cells)
- **Repair**: Wound healing (fibroblasts, ECM)
