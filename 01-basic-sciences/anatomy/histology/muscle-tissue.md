# Muscle Tissue

## Introduction

Muscle tissue is specialized for contraction, enabling movement of the body, organs, and substances within the body. Muscle cells (muscle fibers) contain abundant contractile proteins organized into myofilaments. The three types of muscle tissue—skeletal, cardiac, and smooth—have distinct structures, locations, and functional properties.

### Learning Objectives

1. Identify and differentiate the three types of muscle tissue
2. Describe the ultrastructure of skeletal muscle and the sarcomere
3. Understand the molecular basis of muscle contraction
4. Recognize unique features of cardiac muscle (intercalated discs)
5. Compare and contrast the three muscle types
6. Correlate muscle structure with function and clinical conditions

## General Characteristics of Muscle Tissue

**Shared Features:**
- **Contractility**: Ability to shorten and generate force
- **Excitability**: Respond to stimuli (electrical, chemical)
- **Extensibility**: Can be stretched
- **Elasticity**: Return to original length after stretching
- **Abundant myofilaments**: Actin (thin filaments) and myosin (thick filaments)
- **High metabolic activity**: Rich in mitochondria, glycogen, myoglobin
- **Terminology**:
  - Cell membrane = **Sarcolemma**
  - Cytoplasm = **Sarcoplasm**
  - Smooth endoplasmic reticulum = **Sarcoplasmic reticulum**

## Skeletal Muscle

### General Characteristics

**Structure:**
- Long, cylindrical, multinucleated cells (**muscle fibers**)
- **Peripheral nuclei** (multiple, ~100 per mm)
- **Striated** appearance (alternating light and dark bands)
- **Voluntary** control (somatic nervous system)

**Functions:**
- Locomotion (movement)
- Posture maintenance
- Facial expression
- Breathing (diaphragm, intercostals)
- Eye movement
- Heat production

**Organization:**
- Individual muscle fiber
- **Fascicle**: Bundle of muscle fibers
- **Muscle**: Bundle of fascicles

**Connective Tissue Sheaths:**
- **Endomysium**: Surrounds each muscle fiber (reticular fibers, capillaries)
- **Perimysium**: Surrounds fascicles (collagen, blood vessels, nerves)
- **Epimysium**: Surrounds entire muscle (dense irregular connective tissue)
- Continuous with **tendons** (attach muscle to bone)

### Microscopic Structure

**Light Microscopy (H&E):**
- Long, parallel fibers
- **Cross-striations**: Alternating light and dark bands perpendicular to fiber axis
- **Peripheral nuclei** (multiple, elongated)
- **Pink cytoplasm** (eosinophilic, abundant protein)

**Longitudinal Section:**
- **A band** (dark, anisotropic): Thick filaments (myosin) + overlapping thin filaments
  - **H zone**: Within A band, lighter (only thick filaments, no overlap)
  - **M line**: Midline of H zone (cross-links between thick filaments)
- **I band** (light, isotropic): Thin filaments (actin) only
  - **Z line (Z disc)**: Bisects I band, dark line (anchors thin filaments)

**Cross Section:**
- Polygonal profiles
- Peripheral nuclei
- Myofibrils visible as dots

### Ultrastructure (Electron Microscopy)

**Myofibrils:**
- Cylindrical structures running length of fiber
- Composed of repeating contractile units: **Sarcomeres**

**Sarcomere:**
- **Functional contractile unit** of skeletal muscle
- Segment between two Z lines
- Length: ~2.5 μm (relaxed)

**Components:**
- **Z line (Z disc)**: Anchors thin filaments, defines sarcomere boundaries
  - Contains α-actinin
- **Thin filaments**: Extend from Z line toward center
  - **Actin**: Globular (G-actin) polymerizes into filamentous (F-actin)
  - **Tropomyosin**: Covers myosin-binding sites on actin (resting state)
  - **Troponin complex**: Regulatory protein
    - **Troponin T**: Binds tropomyosin
    - **Troponin I**: Inhibits actin-myosin interaction
    - **Troponin C**: Binds Ca²⁺ (triggers contraction)
- **Thick filaments**: Centered in sarcomere
  - **Myosin II**: Molecular motor
    - Tail: Forms thick filament backbone
    - Head: ATPase activity, binds actin (forms cross-bridge)
  - Arranged in antiparallel orientation
- **Elastic filaments**: **Titin** (largest protein in body)
  - Extends from Z line to M line
  - Provides elasticity, centers thick filaments
- **M line**: Cross-links thick filaments at center (myomesin, creatine kinase)

**Banding Pattern:**
- **I band**: Light (thin filaments only) - isotropic
- **A band**: Dark (thick filaments ± thin filaments overlap) - anisotropic
- **H zone**: Lighter region within A band (thick filaments only, no overlap)
- **M line**: Dark line in center of H zone

### Muscle Contraction (Sliding Filament Theory)

**Mechanism:**

1. **Resting State:**
   - Tropomyosin blocks myosin-binding sites on actin
   - Low sarcoplasmic [Ca²⁺]

2. **Excitation:**
   - Action potential travels along sarcolemma
   - Invades **T-tubules** (transverse tubules):
     - Invaginations of sarcolemma at A-I junctions
     - Carry action potential deep into fiber
   - **Dihydropyridine receptors** (DHPRs) in T-tubule membrane sense voltage change
   - DHPRs physically coupled to **ryanodine receptors** (RyRs) in sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane
   - RyRs open → **Ca²⁺ release** from sarcoplasmic reticulum into sarcoplasm

3. **Contraction:**
   - Ca²⁺ binds **troponin C**
   - Troponin complex undergoes conformational change
   - **Tropomyosin shifts**, exposing myosin-binding sites on actin
   - **Myosin head binds actin** (cross-bridge formation)
   - **Power stroke**: Myosin head pivots, pulling actin toward M line
     - ADP and Pi released
   - **ATP binds myosin** → myosin detaches from actin
   - **ATP hydrolysis** → myosin head "cocked" (ready for next cycle)
   - Cycle repeats as long as Ca²⁺ and ATP present

4. **Relaxation:**
   - Ca²⁺ actively pumped back into sarcoplasmic reticulum (**SERCA**: sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca²⁺-ATPase)
   - [Ca²⁺] decreases in sarcoplasm
   - Troponin-tropomyosin complex returns to resting position
   - Myosin-binding sites blocked
   - Muscle relaxes

**Sarcomere Changes During Contraction:**
- **Shorten**: I bands, H zone, sarcomere length
- **No change**: A band length (thick filaments don't shorten)
- Thin filaments slide past thick filaments (toward M line)

**Energy:**
- **ATP required** for:
  - Myosin head detachment from actin
  - Myosin head cocking (power stroke preparation)
  - Ca²⁺ pump (SERCA)
- Sources: Phosphocreatine (immediate), glycolysis (fast), oxidative phosphorylation (sustained)

### Muscle Fiber Types

**Type I (Slow Oxidative, Red Fibers):**
- **Slow twitch**
- **Aerobic metabolism** (oxidative phosphorylation)
- Many **mitochondria**, high **myoglobin** (red color), rich capillary supply
- Resistant to fatigue
- **Endurance** activities (posture, marathon running)
- Examples: Soleus, paraspinal muscles

**Type IIa (Fast Oxidative-Glycolytic, Intermediate):**
- **Fast twitch**
- Aerobic and anaerobic metabolism
- Moderate mitochondria, myoglobin, capillaries
- Moderately resistant to fatigue
- **Mixed** activities

**Type IIb (Fast Glycolytic, White Fibers):**
- **Fast twitch**
- **Anaerobic metabolism** (glycolysis)
- Few mitochondria, low myoglobin (white), sparse capillaries
- Fatigue easily
- **Power** activities (sprinting, jumping)
- Examples: Extraocular muscles, gastrocnemius

**Note**: Muscles contain mix of fiber types (ratio varies by function, can be altered by training)

### Neuromuscular Junction (Motor End Plate)

**Components:**
- **Presynaptic terminal**: Axon terminal of motor neuron
  - Contains synaptic vesicles (acetylcholine)
- **Synaptic cleft**: Space between neuron and muscle (~50 nm)
  - Contains **acetylcholinesterase** (AChE): Degrades ACh
  - **Basal lamina** present
- **Postsynaptic membrane** (motor end plate): Specialized region of sarcolemma
  - **Junctional folds**: Increase surface area
  - **Nicotinic ACh receptors** (ligand-gated ion channels)

**Transmission:**
1. Action potential arrives at axon terminal
2. Voltage-gated Ca²⁺ channels open → Ca²⁺ influx
3. **Acetylcholine (ACh) released** into synaptic cleft (exocytosis)
4. ACh binds nicotinic receptors on motor end plate
5. Receptor channels open → **Na⁺ influx** (depolarization)
6. **End plate potential** (EPP): Always reaches threshold
7. Action potential generated in sarcolemma
8. AChE degrades ACh (terminates signal)

### Clinical Correlations

**Muscular Dystrophies:**
- **Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD)**:
  - X-linked recessive, **dystrophin gene** mutation
  - **Dystrophin** links actin to sarcolemma (maintains structural integrity)
  - Onset: Early childhood (3-5 years)
  - Progressive weakness (proximal muscles first)
  - Calf pseudohypertrophy (fat/connective tissue replaces muscle)
  - Wheelchair-bound by teens, death by 20s-30s (cardiac/respiratory failure)
  - **Gower sign**: Uses arms to "climb up" legs when standing
  - Elevated **creatine kinase** (CK)
- **Becker Muscular Dystrophy**:
  - Same gene, less severe (partially functional dystrophin)
  - Later onset, slower progression

**Myasthenia Gravis:**
- **Autoimmune**: Antibodies against nicotinic ACh receptors
- Receptor destruction/blockade → impaired neuromuscular transmission
- **Fatigable weakness** (worse with activity)
- Ptosis, diplopia (extraocular muscles affected early)
- Bulbar symptoms (dysphagia, dysarthria)
- **Tensilon test**: Edrophonium (AChE inhibitor) improves strength
- Treatment: AChE inhibitors, immunosuppression, thymectomy

**Malignant Hyperthermia:**
- Genetic (RyR mutation)
- Triggered by anesthetics (halothane, succinylcholine)
- Uncontrolled Ca²⁺ release → sustained muscle contraction
- Hyperthermia, rigidity, rhabdomyolysis, hyperkalemia
- **Treatment**: Dantrolene (blocks RyR)

**Rhabdomyolysis:**
- Muscle breakdown (trauma, drugs, exertion, ischemia)
- **Myoglobinuria** (dark urine)
- **Acute kidney injury** (myoglobin toxic to tubules)
- Elevated CK, K⁺

## Cardiac Muscle

### General Characteristics

**Structure:**
- **Striated** (like skeletal)
- **Branched fibers**
- **Single central nucleus** (rarely 2)
- **Involuntary** control (autonomic nervous system)
- **Intrinsic rhythmicity** (pacemaker cells)

**Location:**
- **Heart** (myocardium)
- Small amounts in pulmonary veins, superior vena cava

**Functions:**
- Pump blood throughout body
- Generate rhythmic, coordinated contractions

### Microscopic Structure

**Light Microscopy:**
- **Striations** present (similar to skeletal muscle)
- **Branching** fibers (interconnected network)
- **Central nuclei** (1-2 per cell, oval)
- **Intercalated discs**: Dark-staining transverse lines (step-like appearance)
  - Junctions between adjacent cardiac myocytes
  - Unique to cardiac muscle

**Intercalated Discs** (Key Feature):
- Located at Z lines
- **Two components**:
  - **Transverse portion** (perpendicular to fiber):
    - **Fascia adherens**: Anchors actin filaments (similar to adherens junction)
    - **Desmosomes**: Strong mechanical adhesion (resist shearing)
  - **Lateral portion** (parallel to fiber):
    - **Gap junctions**: Electrical coupling (allow ion flow)
      - Enable **synchronized contraction** (functional syncytium)
      - Rapid spread of action potential

**Ultrastructure:**
- Myofibrils and sarcomeres similar to skeletal muscle (same banding pattern)
- **T-tubules**: Larger diameter, at Z lines (not A-I junctions)
- **Sarcoplasmic reticulum**: Less extensive than skeletal
- **Abundant mitochondria** (30-40% of cell volume)
  - High aerobic metabolism (dependent on O₂)
- **Atrial granules**: ANP and BNP storage (atrial myocytes)

### Contraction

**Excitation-Contraction Coupling:**
- Similar to skeletal muscle but with key differences:

1. Action potential travels along sarcolemma and T-tubules
2. **DHPRs** in T-tubule function as **L-type Ca²⁺ channels**
   - NOT just voltage sensors (as in skeletal)
   - Open → **Ca²⁺ influx** from extracellular space
3. Ca²⁺ triggers **Ca²⁺-induced Ca²⁺ release** (CICR) from sarcoplasmic reticulum via RyRs
4. [Ca²⁺] increases in sarcoplasm
5. Contraction proceeds as in skeletal muscle (troponin-tropomyosin, cross-bridge cycling)
6. Relaxation: Ca²⁺ pumped out via SERCA (into SR) and Na⁺-Ca²⁺ exchanger (out of cell)

**Key Difference from Skeletal:**
- Cardiac muscle requires **extracellular Ca²⁺** for contraction
- **Long refractory period** prevents tetanus (summation impossible)
  - Ensures relaxation between beats (ventricular filling)

**Regulation:**
- **Autonomic nervous system**:
  - Sympathetic: Increases rate and force (β1-adrenergic receptors, ↑cAMP → ↑Ca²⁺)
  - Parasympathetic: Decreases rate (muscarinic receptors, ↓cAMP)
- **Intrinsic rhythm**: Pacemaker cells (SA node, AV node)

### Clinical Correlations

**Myocardial Infarction (Heart Attack):**
- Ischemia → necrosis of cardiac myocytes
- **Cardiac muscle does NOT regenerate** (minimal satellite cells)
- Scar tissue (collagen) replaces dead muscle
- Elevated **cardiac troponins** (I, T): Biomarkers

**Heart Failure:**
- Impaired contractility
- Chronic: Hypertrophy, fibrosis, remodeling

**Arrhythmias:**
- Abnormal electrical conduction
- Can result from gap junction dysfunction

## Smooth Muscle

### General Characteristics

**Structure:**
- **Spindle-shaped** (fusiform) cells
- **Single central nucleus** (elongated, cigar-shaped)
- **Non-striated** (no sarcomeres)
- **Involuntary** control (autonomic nervous system, hormones, local factors)

**Locations:**

- **Single central nucleus** (elongated)
- **No striations**
- **Eosinophilic cytoplasm** (pink)

**Longitudinal Section:**

  - Dense bodies: Contain α-actinin, distributed throughout cytoplasm and on membrane
- **Myosin filaments**: Interspersed among actin
  - Side-polar arrangement (heads on both ends)
- **Intermediate filaments** (desmin, vimentin): Maintain cell shape
- **Caveolae**: Membrane invaginations (analogous to T-tubules, increase surface area)
- **Sparse sarcoplasmic reticulum**

### Contraction

**Mechanism:**
- Different from striated muscle (no troponin)

1. **Ca²⁺ enters** cell:
   - Via voltage-gated Ca²⁺ channels
   - From sarcoplasmic reticulum (Ca²⁺-induced Ca²⁺ release)
   - From extracellular space (through caveolae)
2. Ca²⁺ binds **calmodulin** (NOT troponin)
3. **Ca²⁺-calmodulin complex** activates **myosin light chain kinase (MLCK)**
4. MLCK phosphorylates **myosin light chain**
5. **Phosphorylated myosin** can bind actin and hydrolyze ATP
6. **Cross-bridge cycling** → contraction
7. **Relaxation**:
   - Ca²⁺ removed from cytoplasm
   - **Myosin light chain phosphatase (MLCP)** dephosphorylates myosin
   - Myosin cannot bind actin → relaxation

**Regulation:**
- **Autonomic nervous system**:
  - Sympathetic: Variable (α-adrenergic → contraction in vessels; β2-adrenergic → relaxation in airways/vessels)
  - Parasympathetic: Variable by organ (contraction in GI; relaxation in airways)
- **Hormones**: Oxytocin (uterus), vasopressin, angiotensin II
- **Local factors**: NO (relaxation), endothelin (contraction), stretch

**Characteristics:**
- **Slow contraction** (compared to skeletal)

- Increased vascular smooth muscle tone
- Vasoconstriction
- Treatment: Ca²⁺ channel blockers, vasodilators

**Uterine Atony:**
- Failure of uterine smooth muscle to contract after delivery

| Locations | Attached to bones, tongue, diaphragm | Heart | Hollow organs, vessels |

## Muscle Regeneration

**Skeletal Muscle:**
- **Satellite cells**: Muscle stem cells (between sarcolemma and basement membrane)
- Activated by injury → proliferate → fuse to repair/form new fibers
- Limited regenerative capacity (severe injury → scar)

**Cardiac Muscle:**
- **Minimal regeneration** (very few stem cells)
- Injured areas replaced by **scar tissue** (collagen)

**Smooth Muscle:**
- **Good regenerative capacity**
- Can undergo **mitosis** (divide)

## Key Points

1. Muscle tissue: Specialized for contraction; three types (skeletal, cardiac, smooth)

2. Skeletal muscle: Striated, multinucleated, peripheral nuclei, voluntary, attached to bones

3. Sarcomere: Contractile unit, Z line to Z line; contains thick (myosin) and thin (actin, tropomyosin, troponin) filaments

4. Sliding filament theory: Thin filaments slide past thick filaments; I band and H zone shorten, A band unchanged

5. Muscle contraction: Ca²⁺ binds troponin C → tropomyosin shifts → myosin binds actin → power stroke (requires ATP)

6. Fiber types: Type I (slow oxidative, fatigue-resistant), Type IIb (fast glycolytic, fatigues easily)

7. Neuromuscular junction: Synaptic transmission via acetylcholine; AChE degrades ACh

8. Cardiac muscle: Striated, branched, 1-2 central nuclei, involuntary, intercalated discs (gap junctions, desmosomes)

9. Intercalated discs: Unique to cardiac muscle; electrical coupling (gap junctions) enables synchronized contraction

10. Cardiac muscle: Requires extracellular Ca²⁺, long refractory period (prevents tetanus), does not regenerate

11. Smooth muscle: Non-striated, single central nucleus, spindle-shaped, involuntary, walls of hollow organs

12. Smooth muscle contraction: Ca²⁺-calmodulin activates MLCK → myosin phosphorylation → contraction

13. Multi-unit smooth muscle: Independent cells, fine control (iris, vas deferens)

14. Single-unit smooth muscle: Syncytium, gap junctions, spontaneous activity (GI tract, uterus)

15. Muscular dystrophy: Dystrophin defect (DMD severe, BMD milder); Myasthenia gravis: Anti-ACh receptor antibodies
