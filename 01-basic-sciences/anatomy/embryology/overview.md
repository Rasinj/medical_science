# Overview of Human Development

## Introduction

Human development is a complex, highly coordinated process beginning at fertilization and continuing through fetal development until birth. Understanding the sequential events of embryological development is fundamental to medical practice, enabling clinicians to recognize normal development, identify congenital abnormalities, and counsel patients about teratogenic risks.

### Learning Objectives

1. Describe the stages of early development from fertilization through implantation
2. Understand the formation and derivatives of the three germ layers
3. Explain the major events of the embryonic period (weeks 1-8)
4. Describe fetal development and maturation (weeks 9-40)
5. Recognize critical periods of development and teratogenic susceptibility
6. Understand placental development and function
7. Correlate developmental timing with prenatal screening and diagnosis

## Terminology and Time Frames

### Developmental Periods

**Germinal Period (Weeks 1-2):**
- From fertilization through implantation
- Cleavage, morula, blastocyst formation
- Implantation into uterine wall

**Embryonic Period (Weeks 3-8):**
- **Most critical period for organogenesis**
- All major organ systems established
- Highest susceptibility to teratogens
- Period when most major congenital anomalies occur

**Fetal Period (Weeks 9-Birth):**
- Growth and maturation of established organs
- Size increases dramatically
- Teratogens may affect growth and function rather than structure

### Age Determination

**Gestational Age:**
- Calculated from first day of last menstrual period (LMP)
- Standard for clinical obstetrics
- Approximately 2 weeks longer than embryonic age

**Embryonic Age (Fertilization Age):**
- Calculated from conception
- More accurate for embryological purposes
- This text uses embryonic age unless otherwise specified

**Carnegie Stages:**
- 23 developmental stages based on morphological features
- Used in embryology research
- More precise than week-based dating

## Week 1: Fertilization and Cleavage

### Fertilization

**Location**: Ampulla of uterine (fallopian) tube

**Process:**
1. **Sperm capacitation**: Removal of glycoprotein coat in female reproductive tract
2. **Acrosome reaction**: Release of enzymes to penetrate corona radiata and zona pellucida
3. **Fusion**: Sperm and oocyte membranes fuse
4. **Cortical reaction**: Prevents polyspermy (multiple sperm entry)
   - Zona pellucida hardens
   - Oocyte membrane becomes impermeable
5. **Completion of meiosis II**: Oocyte completes second meiotic division
6. **Pronuclei formation**: Male and female pronuclei form
7. **Syngamy**: Pronuclei fuse, forming zygote (46 chromosomes, 2n)

**Clinical Correlations:**
- **Digynic triploidy**: Two eggs fertilized by one sperm (69,XXX or 69,XXY)
- **Diandric triploidy**: One egg fertilized by two sperm
- **Abnormal fertilization** leads to molar pregnancies or early loss

### Cleavage (Days 1-4)

**Process:**
- Series of mitotic divisions without growth
- Cell size decreases with each division
- **Blastomeres**: Daughter cells

**Stages:**
1. **2-cell stage** (Day 1, ~30 hours post-fertilization)
2. **4-cell stage** (Day 2)
3. **8-cell stage** (Day 3)
4. **Morula** (Day 3-4): 16-32 cells
   - Solid ball of cells
   - "Morula" = mulberry
   - Still within zona pellucida

**Clinical Correlations:**
- **In vitro fertilization (IVF)**: Embryo transfer typically at 8-cell or blastocyst stage
- **Preimplantation genetic diagnosis**: Blastomere biopsy for genetic testing

### Blastocyst Formation (Days 4-6)

**Process:**
- Fluid accumulates within morula
- Formation of cavity (blastocoel)

**Structure:**
- **Trophoblast**: Outer cell layer
  - Forms placenta and fetal membranes
  - Does NOT contribute to embryo proper
- **Inner cell mass (embryoblast)**: Inner cluster of cells
  - Forms the embryo proper
  - Pluripotent stem cells
- **Blastocoel**: Fluid-filled cavity

**Clinical Correlations:**
- **Embryonic stem cells**: Derived from inner cell mass
- **Trophoblastic disease**: Abnormal trophoblast proliferation (molar pregnancy)

### Hatching and Implantation (Days 6-7)

**Hatching (Day 5-6):**
- Blastocyst "hatches" from zona pellucida
- Enables implantation

**Implantation (Days 6-12):**
- Typically in upper posterior uterine wall

**Stages:**
1. **Apposition** (Day 6): Blastocyst adheres to endometrium
2. **Adhesion** (Day 7): Trophoblast adheres to uterine epithelium
3. **Invasion** (Days 8-12): Trophoblast invades endometrium

**Trophoblast Differentiation:**
- **Cytotrophoblast**: Inner layer of mononuclear cells

  - Risk factors: PID, prior ectopic, tubal surgery
  - Presentation: Abdominal pain, vaginal bleeding, may rupture
- **Placenta previa**: Implantation near or over internal cervical os
- **hCG detection**: Basis for pregnancy tests (detectable 8-10 days post-fertilization)

## Week 2: Bilaminar Disc

### Formation of Bilaminar Disc (Days 8-14)

**Inner Cell Mass Differentiation:**
- **Epiblast**: Dorsal layer (columnar cells)

## Fetal Circulation

### Key Features

**Shunts (Bypass Structures):**

2. **Foramen ovale**: Right atrium → Left atrium (bypasses lungs)
3. **Ductus arteriosus**: Pulmonary artery → Aorta (bypasses lungs)

### Circulation Pathway

1. Oxygenated blood from placenta via **umbilical vein**
2. **Ductus venosus** → IVC
3. IVC → **Right atrium**
4. Most blood crosses **foramen ovale** → **Left atrium**
   - (Some goes to right ventricle)
5. Left atrium → Left ventricle → Ascending aorta → Head/upper body
6. Deoxygenated blood from upper body → SVC → Right atrium
7. Right atrium → Right ventricle → Pulmonary artery
8. Most blood through **ductus arteriosus** → Descending aorta
   - (Small amount to lungs)
9. Descending aorta → Lower body
10. **Umbilical arteries** (from internal iliacs) → Placenta

### Changes at Birth

**Triggers:**
- First breath
- Increased oxygen
- Decreased prostaglandins
- Clamping of umbilical cord

**Changes:**
1. **Lungs expand**: Pulmonary vascular resistance decreases
2. **Umbilical vessels constrict**:
   - **Umbilical vein** → **Ligamentum teres hepatis**
   - **Umbilical arteries** → **Medial umbilical ligaments**
   - **Ductus venosus** → **Ligamentum venosum**
3. **Foramen ovale closes**:
   - Increased left atrial pressure
   - Functional closure immediate
   - Anatomical closure over months
   - → **Fossa ovalis**
4. **Ductus arteriosus closes**:
   - Increased O₂, decreased prostaglandins
   - Functional closure in hours
   - Anatomical closure in weeks
   - → **Ligamentum arteriosum**

**Clinical Correlations:**
- **Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA)**: Failure of closure
  - Common in premature infants
  - Treated with indomethacin (inhibits prostaglandin) or surgery
- **Patent foramen ovale**: Common (25% of adults)
  - Usually asymptomatic
  - Can cause paradoxical embolism
- **Persistent fetal circulation**: Pulmonary hypertension of newborn

### Indications for Prenatal Diagnosis

- Advanced maternal age (≥35 years at delivery)
- Abnormal screening results
- Family history of genetic disorder
- Previous child with chromosomal abnormality
- Abnormal ultrasound findings
- Parental carrier of chromosomal rearrangement

## Key Points

1. Development divided into germinal (weeks 1-2), embryonic (weeks 3-8), and fetal (weeks 9-birth) periods

2. Fertilization occurs in ampulla of fallopian tube; implantation in uterus at day 6-7

3. Week 2: Bilaminar disc forms (epiblast and hypoblast); "week of twos"

4. Week 3: Gastrulation creates three germ layers (ectoderm, mesoderm, endoderm); neurulation begins

5. Ectoderm forms nervous system, epidermis, and neural crest derivatives

6. Mesoderm forms muscle, bone, cardiovascular system, and urogenital system

7. Endoderm forms epithelial linings of GI, respiratory, and urinary tracts

8. Weeks 3-8 (embryonic period) are most critical for teratogenic effects

9. Neural tube closes days 22-28; failure causes anencephaly (anterior) or spina bifida (posterior)

10. Folic acid supplementation prevents neural tube defects

11. Fetal circulation includes three shunts: ductus venosus, foramen ovale, ductus arteriosus

12. At birth, fetal shunts close; failure leads to patent ductus arteriosus or patent foramen ovale

13. Common teratogens include alcohol, isotretinoin, valproate, and TORCH infections

14. Prenatal screening includes nuchal translucency, serum markers, cell-free fetal DNA, and ultrasound

15. Prenatal diagnosis via CVS (10-13 weeks) or amniocentesis (15-20 weeks)
