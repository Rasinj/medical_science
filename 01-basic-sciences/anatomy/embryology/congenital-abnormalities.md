# Congenital Abnormalities

## Introduction

Congenital abnormalities (birth defects) are structural or functional anomalies present at birth. They affect approximately 3-5% of live births and are a leading cause of infant mortality. Understanding their embryological basis is essential for recognition, management, and genetic counseling.

### Learning Objectives

1. Recognize common congenital abnormalities by organ system
2. Understand the embryological basis of major birth defects
3. Identify teratogens and their associated anomalies
4. Describe chromosomal abnormalities and their phenotypes
5. Correlate abnormalities with critical developmental periods
6. Understand genetic counseling principles

## Classification of Congenital Abnormalities

### By Mechanism

**Malformation:**
- Primary structural defect due to abnormal developmental process
- Examples: Neural tube defects, cardiac septal defects

**Deformation:**
- Abnormal form or position due to mechanical forces
- Usually affects normally formed structures
- Examples: Clubfoot from oligohydramnios, positional plagiocephaly

**Disruption:**
- Breakdown of normally developing structure
- Secondary to destructive process
- Examples: Amniotic band sequence, vascular accidents

**Dysplasia:**
- Abnormal organization of cells into tissues
- Examples: Skeletal dysplasias, vascular malformations

### By Timing

**Embryonic Period (Weeks 3-8):**
- Major structural abnormalities
- Most critical period

**Fetal Period (Weeks 9-Birth):**
- Growth and functional abnormalities
- Some structural defects (e.g., palate, external genitalia)

### By Pattern

**Isolated Anomaly:**
- Single defect in otherwise normal individual

**Syndrome:**
- Multiple anomalies with common etiology
- Examples: Down syndrome, VACTERL

**Sequence:**
- Pattern of multiple anomalies from single primary defect
- Example: Potter sequence (renal agenesis → oligohydramnios → pulmonary hypoplasia + limb deformities)

**Association:**
- Nonrandom occurrence of anomalies
- No known common etiology
- Example: VACTERL
