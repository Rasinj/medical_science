# Cardiovascular Pathology

## Overview

Cardiovascular diseases remain the leading cause of mortality worldwide, accounting for approximately 30% of all deaths. This section covers the pathology of the heart and blood vessels, including ischemic heart disease, heart failure, valvular disorders, hypertensive disease, congenital abnormalities, and vascular pathology.

### Epidemiology
- **Global burden**: Leading cause of death in developed countries
- **Risk factors**: Hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, smoking, obesity
- **Age-related**: Incidence increases significantly with age
- **Gender differences**: Men at higher risk until menopause in women
- **Preventable**: Many cardiovascular diseases are modifiable through lifestyle

## Ischemic Heart Disease (IHD)

### Definition and Epidemiology
Ischemic heart disease results from an imbalance between myocardial oxygen supply and demand, most commonly due to coronary artery atherosclerosis.

- **Prevalence**: Most common cause of death in adults worldwide
- **Mortality**: Approximately 1 in 4 deaths in the United States
- **Economic impact**: Highest healthcare costs of any disease category

### Atherosclerosis

#### Pathogenesis
**Response-to-injury hypothesis**:
1. **Endothelial injury**: Risk factors cause endothelial dysfunction
   - Hemodynamic stress (hypertension, turbulent flow)
   - Hypercholesterolemia (LDL oxidation)
   - Inflammation (cytokines, infections)
   - Smoking toxins
   - Diabetes (advanced glycation end products)

2. **Lipoprotein accumulation**: LDL enters intima and undergoes oxidation
   - Oxidized LDL is cytotoxic and pro-inflammatory
   - Stimulates endothelial expression of adhesion molecules
   - Recruits monocytes to intima

3. **Monocyte adhesion and migration**:
   - VCAM-1, ICAM-1, selectins mediate adhesion
   - Chemokines (MCP-1) promote migration
   - Monocytes differentiate into macrophages

4. **Foam cell formation**:
   - Macrophages ingest oxidized LDL via scavenger receptors
   - Unlike LDL receptors, scavenger receptors are not downregulated
   - Lipid-laden macrophages become foam cells
   - Foam cell death releases lipids into extracellular space

5. **Smooth muscle proliferation**:
   - PDGF, FGF, TGF-β stimulate SMC migration from media
   - SMCs proliferate and synthesize extracellular matrix
   - Forms fibrous cap over lipid core

6. **Plaque progression**:
   - Continued inflammation and lipid accumulation
   - Calcification develops
   - Neovascularization from vasa vasorum
   - Intraplaque hemorrhage

#### Plaque Morphology
**Fatty streak** (earliest lesion):
- Lipid-laden foam cells in intima
- No flow disturbance
- Present in young individuals
- May regress or progress

**Fibrous plaque**:
- Raised, firm, white lesion
- Fibrous cap: SMCs, collagen, elastin
- Lipid core: foam cells, extracellular lipid, necrotic debris
- Shoulder regions: site of active inflammation

**Complicated plaque**:
- Calcification: dystrophic calcification in necrotic areas
- Ulceration: endothelial erosion
- Hemorrhage: rupture of vasa vasorum
- Thrombosis: plaque rupture exposes thrombogenic material

#### Vulnerable Plaque Characteristics
- **Thin fibrous cap** (<65 μm): prone to rupture
- **Large lipid core** (>40% of plaque volume)
- **Active inflammation**: abundant macrophages, T cells
- **Outward remodeling**: positive remodeling preserves lumen
- **Intraplaque hemorrhage**: iron deposition, inflammation
- **Superficial calcification**: spotty calcification in cap

#### Acute Plaque Changes
**Plaque rupture** (60-70% of acute MI):
- Fibrous cap disruption
- Exposure of thrombogenic lipid core
- Platelet activation and aggregation
- Thrombin generation and fibrin formation
- Occlusive or mural thrombus

**Plaque erosion** (20-30% of acute MI):
- Endothelial denudation without cap rupture
- Smooth muscle cells and proteoglycans exposed
- More common in women and diabetics
- Less inflammation than rupture

**Calcified nodule** (2-5% of acute MI):
- Calcified plate protrudes through thin fibrous cap
- Fibrin deposition over nodule
- Associated with healed plaque ruptures

### Angina Pectoris

#### Stable Angina
**Pathophysiology**:
- Fixed coronary stenosis (usually >70% luminal narrowing)
- Adequate perfusion at rest
- Insufficient supply during increased demand
- Reversible myocardial ischemia

**Pathology**:
- Chronic atherosclerotic plaques
- Compensatory arterial remodeling
- May have collateral circulation

#### Unstable Angina
**Pathophysiology**:
- Acute plaque change (rupture, erosion, hemorrhage)
- Partial thrombosis
- Vasoconstriction
- Microembolization
- Progressive lumen narrowing

**Pathology**:
- Active plaque with disruption
- Non-occlusive thrombus
- Platelet aggregates
- No myocardial necrosis (differentiates from MI)

#### Prinzmetal (Variant) Angina
**Pathophysiology**:
- Coronary artery vasospasm
- May occur in normal or atherosclerotic vessels
- Often at rest, circadian pattern

**Mechanisms**:
- Endothelial dysfunction
- Smooth muscle hyperreactivity
- Abnormal autonomic tone

### Myocardial Infarction

#### Classification
**STEMI** (ST-elevation MI):
- Transmural infarction
- Complete coronary occlusion
- ST elevation on ECG
- Elevated cardiac biomarkers

**NSTEMI** (Non-ST-elevation MI):
- Subendocardial infarction
- Partial or intermittent occlusion
- No ST elevation
- Elevated cardiac biomarkers

#### Pathophysiology
**Sequence of events**:
1. **Acute coronary thrombosis** (90% of cases)
   - Plaque rupture or erosion
   - Thrombogenic material exposure
   - Platelet aggregation and coagulation cascade
   - Complete or near-complete occlusion

2. **Ischemia**: Oxygen deprivation to myocardium
   - Aerobic metabolism ceases within seconds
   - ATP depletion begins
   - Anaerobic glycolysis produces lactate

3. **Cellular injury**:
   - Membrane dysfunction
   - Ion pump failure
   - Calcium influx
   - Cell swelling

4. **Necrosis**:
   - Irreversible injury after 20-40 minutes

## Heart Failure

### Definition and Classification
Heart failure is a clinical syndrome resulting from structural or functional cardiac abnormality that impairs ventricular filling or ejection.

**Classification by ejection fraction**:
- **HFrEF** (Heart failure with reduced EF): EF <40%
- **HFmrEF** (Heart failure with mid-range EF): EF 40-49%
- **HFpEF** (Heart failure with preserved EF): EF ≥50%

**Classification by symptoms**:
- **NYHA Class I**: No limitation of physical activity
- **NYHA Class II**: Slight limitation; comfortable at rest
- **NYHA Class III**: Marked limitation; comfortable only at rest
- **NYHA Class IV**: Symptoms at rest; any activity causes discomfort

### Pathophysiology

   - ADH: Water retention
3. **Ventricular remodeling**: Hypertrophy, chamber dilatation
   - Initially adaptive, ultimately maladaptive

**Pathological consequences**:

## Key Points

### Ischemic Heart Disease
- Atherosclerosis is the underlying cause in >90% of cases
- Plaque rupture/erosion triggers thrombosis in acute coronary syndromes
- Myocardial infarction shows characteristic temporal evolution
- Complications include arrhythmias, rupture, heart failure, aneurysm

### Heart Failure
- Results from systolic dysfunction, diastolic dysfunction, or both
- Compensatory mechanisms initially maintain output but ultimately worsen disease
- Left heart failure causes pulmonary congestion
- Right heart failure causes systemic venous congestion

### Valvular Disease
- Rheumatic heart disease is leading cause of mitral stenosis
- Calcific aortic stenosis is most common valvular disease in elderly
- Infective endocarditis can occur on normal or abnormal valves
- Hemodynamic consequences depend on acuity and severity

### Vascular Disease
- AAA rupture risk correlates with size
- Aortic dissection is a surgical emergency if ascending aorta involved
- Hypertension is major risk factor for both aneurysm and dissection
