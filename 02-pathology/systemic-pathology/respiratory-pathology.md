# Respiratory Pathology

## Overview

Respiratory diseases represent a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, ranging from acute infections to chronic progressive conditions and malignancies. This section covers pathology of the lungs, airways, pleura, and related structures, emphasizing pathophysiology, morphology, and clinical correlation.

### Epidemiology
- **Global burden**: Lower respiratory infections are the 4th leading cause of death worldwide
- **COPD**: 3rd leading cause of death globally
- **Lung cancer**: Leading cause of cancer-related death
- **Preventable**: Smoking remains the most important modifiable risk factor

## Obstructive Lung Diseases

### General Characteristics
**Functional definition**: Airflow limitation with decreased FEV₁/FVC ratio (<0.70)

**Common features**:

- Asthma
- Bronchiectasis
- Bronchiolitis

### Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)

#### Definition and Classification
COPD is a preventable and treatable disease characterized by persistent respiratory symptoms and airflow limitation due to airway and/or alveolar abnormalities.

**Components**:
- **Chronic bronchitis**: Clinical diagnosis (chronic productive cough ≥3 months for ≥2 consecutive years)
- **Emphysema**: Pathological diagnosis (permanent enlargement of airspaces distal to terminal bronchioles with wall destruction)

#### Epidemiology
- Prevalence: 10-15% of adults >40 years
- 4th leading cause of death in United States
