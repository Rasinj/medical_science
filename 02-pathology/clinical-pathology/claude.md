# Clinical Pathology

## Overview

Clinical pathology is the medical specialty that focuses on the diagnosis and monitoring of disease through laboratory analysis of body fluids, tissues, and cells. It encompasses the fields of laboratory medicine, diagnostic pathology, and molecular diagnostics, serving as the foundation for evidence-based clinical decision-making. Clinical pathologists oversee laboratory operations, ensure quality control, interpret test results, and correlate laboratory findings with clinical presentations.
