**Created Top-Level Directory Structure**
- Created 10 main directories for medical education organization:
  - `01-basic-sciences/` - Pre-clinical foundation sciences
  - `02-pathology/` - Disease processes and mechanisms  
  - `03-pharmacology/` - Drug therapy and therapeutics
  - `04-clinical-medicine/` - Core clinical specialties
  - `05-surgery/` - Surgical disciplines
  - `06-emergency-critical-care/` - Acute and intensive care

- **10-ethics-professionalism/**: `medical-ethics/`, `medical-law/`, `professionalism/`, `research-ethics/`, `end-of-life-care/`, `informed-consent/`, `cultural-competency/`

## 2025-06-06 10:40:00 UTC
**Created Core Markdown Template Files**
- **01-basic-sciences/**: Created 11 core files with standard template structure
  - `physiology/`: cardiovascular, respiratory, renal, endocrine, neuro, GI physiology
  - `biochemistry/`: metabolism, molecular-biology, clinical-biochemistry
  - `immunology/`: innate-immunity, adaptive-immunity
- **02-pathology/**: Created 5 core files: general-pathology, cellular-pathology, inflammation, neoplasia, genetic-disorders
- **04-clinical-medicine/**: Created 10 core files
  - `psychiatry/`: mood-disorders, psychotic-disorders, anxiety-disorders, personality-disorders, substance-use-disorders
  - `neurology/`: stroke, epilepsy, movement-disorders, dementia, headache
- All files include standardized template: Overview, Pathophysiology, Clinical Presentation, Diagnosis, Treatment, Complications, Prognosis, Key Points, References

## 2025-06-06 10:42:00 UTC
**Created Subspecialty Template Structure**
- Implemented standardized subspecialty directory structure as specified in TODO #17
- **Template applied to gross-anatomy/**: Created overview.md, common-conditions.md, procedures.md, medications.md
- **case-studies/ directories**: Created in all anatomy subspecialties (gross-anatomy, neuroanatomy, embryology, histology)
- This establishes the pattern for all future subspecialty directories: each should contain the 5 standard files

## 2025-06-06 10:45:00 UTC
**Created Claude.md Documentation Files**
- **Root claude.md**: Comprehensive overview of entire medical education structure
- **Top-level domain claude.md files**: Created for 01-basic-sciences, 02-pathology, 03-pharmacology, 04-clinical-medicine, 05-surgery, 06-emergency-critical-care, 10-ethics-professionalism
- **Subdirectory claude.md files**: Created for anatomy, gross-anatomy, physiology
- Each claude.md provides detailed directory contents, learning objectives, and clinical applications
- Systematic documentation of all content scope and educational structure
