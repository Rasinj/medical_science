# General Principles of Pharmacology

## Overview

This subdirectory covers the fundamental principles of pharmacology that apply across all drug classes. Understanding these core concepts is essential for rational drug therapy and forms the foundation for studying specific drug classes.

## Scope

The general principles of pharmacology encompass:

### 1. Pharmacokinetics
- **Absorption**: Mechanisms of drug absorption, bioavailability, first-pass metabolism
- **Distribution**: Volume of distribution, protein binding, blood-brain barrier
- **Metabolism**: Phase I and II reactions, cytochrome P450 system
- **Excretion**: Renal and hepatic clearance, elimination half-life

### 2. Pharmacodynamics
- **Dose-Response Relationships**: EC50, Emax, potency vs. efficacy
- **Receptor Theory**: Types of receptors, signal transduction
- **Drug-Receptor Interactions**: Agonists, antagonists, partial agonists
- **Therapeutic Index**: Margin of safety, toxic dose ratios

### 3. Drug Interactions
- **Pharmacokinetic Interactions**: Effects on ADME processes
- **Pharmacodynamic Interactions**: Additive, synergistic, antagonistic effects
- **Clinical Significance**: Major vs. minor interactions
- **Prevention Strategies**: Monitoring, dose adjustments

### 4. Pharmacogenomics
- **Genetic Polymorphisms**: CYP450 variations, receptor variants
- **Clinical Applications**: Personalized medicine, dose optimization
- **Ethnic Differences**: Population-specific genetic variations
- **Testing Indications**: When to consider pharmacogenomic testing

## Clinical Importance

Understanding general pharmacology principles is crucial for:

1. **Rational Drug Prescribing**: Selecting appropriate drugs and doses
2. **Predicting Drug Effects**: Anticipating therapeutic and adverse effects
3. **Managing Drug Interactions**: Recognizing and preventing interactions
4. **Individualizing Therapy**: Adjusting for patient-specific factors
5. **Understanding Drug Development**: How drugs are discovered and tested

## Key Concepts

### Pharmacokinetic Parameters

**Bioavailability (F)**
- Fraction of administered dose reaching systemic circulation
- Affected by absorption and first-pass metabolism
- Important for oral vs. IV dosing equivalence

**Volume of Distribution (Vd)**
- Theoretical volume into which drug distributes
- High Vd: extensive tissue distribution
- Low Vd: confined to plasma

**Clearance (CL)**
- Volume of plasma cleared per unit time
- Determines maintenance dose
- Sum of renal and hepatic clearance

**Half-Life (t½)**
- Time for plasma concentration to decrease by 50%
- Determines dosing interval
- Affected by Vd and CL: t½ = 0.693 × Vd/CL

**Steady State**
- Achieved after 4-5 half-lives
- Rate of drug input equals rate of elimination
- Important for chronic therapy

### Pharmacodynamic Principles

**Potency**
- Amount of drug needed to produce effect
- Determined by EC50 or ED50
- Not necessarily related to clinical efficacy

**Efficacy**
- Maximum effect a drug can produce
- More clinically important than potency
- Determined by Emax

**Therapeutic Window**
- Range between minimum effective and minimum toxic concentrations
- Narrow window requires careful monitoring (e.g., digoxin, warfarin)
- Wide window allows flexible dosing (e.g., penicillins)

**Receptor Selectivity**
- Specificity for target receptor
- Determines side effect profile
- Basis for drug development

## Drug Development and Testing

### Preclinical Studies
1. **In Vitro Studies**: Cell culture, receptor binding
2. **Animal Studies**: Pharmacology, toxicology
3. **Formulation Development**: Dosage forms, stability

### Clinical Trials
- **Phase I**: Safety, pharmacokinetics (20-80 healthy volunteers)
- **Phase II**: Efficacy, dose-ranging (100-300 patients)
- **Phase III**: Large-scale efficacy and safety (1,000-3,000 patients)
- **Phase IV**: Post-marketing surveillance

### Regulatory Approval
- FDA review process
- Risk-benefit assessment
- Labeling requirements
- Post-approval monitoring

## Special Populations

### Pediatric Patients
- Developing enzyme systems
- Different body composition
- Age-specific dosing considerations

### Geriatric Patients
- Decreased renal/hepatic function
- Altered body composition
- Polypharmacy concerns
- Increased sensitivity to drugs

### Pregnancy
- FDA pregnancy categories (historical)
- Teratogenicity concerns
- Placental transfer
- Risk-benefit assessment

### Renal Impairment
- Decreased drug clearance
- Dose adjustments based on CrCl/eGFR
- Active metabolite accumulation
- Dialyzability

### Hepatic Impairment
- Decreased metabolism
- Altered protein binding
- Child-Pugh classification
- Dose adjustments

## Adverse Drug Reactions

### Classification
1. **Type A (Augmented)**: Dose-dependent, predictable
2. **Type B (Bizarre)**: Dose-independent, unpredictable
3. **Type C (Chronic)**: Related to cumulative dose
4. **Type D (Delayed)**: Occur after prolonged use
5. **Type E (End of use)**: Withdrawal reactions
6. **Type F (Failure)**: Treatment failure

### Management
- Recognition and reporting
- Discontinuation vs. dose adjustment
- Supportive care
- Alternative therapy selection

## Clinical Pearls

### Dosing Considerations
1. **Loading Dose**: Use when rapid effect needed
   - Loading dose = Vd × Target concentration
2. **Maintenance Dose**: Maintains steady-state
   - Maintenance dose = CL × Target concentration
3. **Dose Adjustments**: Based on renal/hepatic function

### Drug Monitoring
- Narrow therapeutic index drugs require levels
- Time of sampling critical (peak vs. trough)
- Interpret in clinical context

### Common Pitfalls
1. **Ignoring renal/hepatic function**: Leads to toxicity
2. **Not checking for interactions**: Can cause treatment failure or ADRs
3. **Using weight-based dosing in obesity**: May need adjusted body weight
4. **Forgetting first-pass metabolism**: Affects oral bioavailability

## Exam Focus Areas

### High-Yield Topics
1. Pharmacokinetic calculations (t½, Vd, CL, steady-state)
2. CYP450 inducers and inhibitors
3. Receptor types and signal transduction
4. Drug interaction mechanisms
5. Dose-response curves and interpretation
6. Special population considerations
7. Common adverse drug reaction patterns

### Common Question Formats
- Calculation questions: dosing, half-life, clearance

- Clinical scenarios: Patient with renal failure on drug X
- Graph interpretation: Dose-response curves, plasma concentration-time curves
