# Toxicology - Comprehensive Medical Education Content

## Overview

This subdirectory contains comprehensive medical education content for toxicology pharmacology.

## Structure

Each content file (400-600+ lines) includes:
- YAML frontmatter with metadata
- Introduction and core concepts
- Mechanisms of action
- Pharmacokinetics (ADME)
- Pharmacodynamics
- Clinical indications
- Contraindications and warnings
- Adverse effects and toxicity
- Drug interactions
- Clinical pearls (10-15 per file)
- Key takeaways (10-15 per file)
- Board exam focus areas
- References to primary literature and guidelines

## Learning Objectives

Students completing this section will be able to:
1. Explain mechanisms of action for all drug classes
2. Predict pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties
3. Select appropriate therapy for clinical scenarios
4. Recognize and manage adverse effects
5. Identify clinically significant drug interactions
6. Apply evidence-based guidelines to patient care

## Clinical Integration

Content integrates with:
- Basic sciences (biochemistry, microbiology, physiology)
- Clinical specialties (internal medicine, pediatrics, etc.)
- Board examination requirements
- Real-world clinical practice

## Study Approach

1. Master mechanisms before memorizing drugs
2. Focus on high-yield clinical applications
3. Practice with clinical scenarios
4. Review adverse effects and contraindications
5. Understand drug selection rationale
