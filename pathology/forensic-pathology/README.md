# Forensic Pathology

## Overview
Forensic pathology is the specialized branch of pathology that focuses on determining the cause of death through examination of a corpse and the investigation of sudden, unexpected, or violent deaths. Forensic pathologists serve as critical links between medicine and the legal system, providing expert medical opinions in criminal and civil legal proceedings.
