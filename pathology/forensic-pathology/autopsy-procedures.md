# Autopsy Procedures

## Overview
The forensic autopsy is a systematic, comprehensive postmortem examination performed to determine the cause and manner of death, document injuries, collect evidence, and provide medical information for legal proceedings. Unlike hospital autopsies, forensic autopsies are performed under legal authority and follow strict protocols for evidence handling and documentation.

## Principles of Forensic Autopsy

### Purpose and Objectives
1. **Determine Cause of Death**
   - Identify the disease or injury responsible for death
   - Document pathological findings
   - Correlate clinical and autopsy findings

2. **Establish Manner of Death**
   - Natural
   - Homicide
   - Suicide
   - Accident
   - Undetermined

3. **Evidence Collection**
   - Physical evidence preservation
   - Biological specimens for toxicology
   - Documentation for legal proceedings

4. **Answer Specific Questions**
   - Identity confirmation
   - Time of death estimation
   - Weapon identification
   - Injury sequence and mechanism

### Legal Authority and Jurisdiction
- **Medical Examiner System**: Appointed physician with legal authority
- **Coroner System**: Elected official (may or may not be a physician)
- **Statutory Authority**: State laws defining jurisdiction
- **Reportable Deaths**: Sudden, unexpected, violent, suspicious, or unattended

### Types of Autopsies
1. **Complete Autopsy**: Full external and internal examination
2. **Limited Autopsy**: Examination of specific regions (with authorization)
3. **Exhumation Autopsy**: Examination after burial/disinterment
4. **Re-autopsy**: Second examination of previously autopsied body
