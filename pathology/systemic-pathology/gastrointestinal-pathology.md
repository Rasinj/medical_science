# Gastrointestinal Pathology

## Overview

Gastrointestinal diseases encompass a wide spectrum of disorders affecting the digestive tract from esophagus to anus, as well as associated organs including liver, pancreas, and biliary system. These conditions range from inflammatory disorders to malignancies and represent major causes of morbidity worldwide.

### Epidemiology
- **GI malignancies**: Among leading causes of cancer death (colorectal, gastric, liver, pancreatic)
- **Inflammatory bowel disease**: Increasing incidence globally
- **Liver disease**: Major contributor to mortality (viral hepatitis, cirrhosis)
- **Peptic ulcer disease**: Declining due to H. pylori eradication and PPI use

## Esophageal Pathology

### Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD)

#### Definition
Chronic condition with reflux of gastric contents into esophagus causing symptoms and/or complications.

#### Pathophysiology
**Mechanisms**:
- **Lower esophageal sphincter (LES) dysfunction**:
  - Transient LES relaxations
  - Decreased resting tone
  - Anatomical disruption (hiatal hernia)

**Contributing factors**:
- Obesity (increased abdominal pressure)
- Pregnancy
- Medications (calcium channel blockers, nitrates)
- Foods (caffeine, chocolate, alcohol, fatty foods)
- Delayed gastric emptying

#### Pathology
**Gross**: May appear normal or show erythema, erosions, ulcers

**Microscopic** (Reflux esophagitis):
- **Basal zone hyperplasia**: >15-20% of epithelial thickness
- **Papillary elongation**: >2/3 of epithelial thickness
- **Intraepithelial eosinophils**: >5 per HPF
- **Intraepithelial neutrophils**: Severe disease
- **Erosions and ulcerations**: Advanced disease
- Dilated intercellular spaces

#### Complications
**Barrett's Esophagus**:

- **Pathology**:
  - Intestinal metaplasia with goblet cells (diagnostic)
  - Salmon-colored mucosa endoscopically
  - Extends proximally from GE junction
- **Significance**: Premalignant (adenocarcinoma risk)
- **Surveillance**: Dysplasia assessment

  - Low-grade dysplasia: Every 6-12 months
  - High-grade dysplasia: Endoscopic therapy

**Strictures**: Fibrous narrowing from chronic inflammation

**Hemorrhage**: From erosions and ulcers

### Cirrhosis

#### Definition
Diffuse hepatic fibrosis with nodular regeneration, disrupting normal architecture.

#### Pathogenesis
**Chronic liver injury** → Hepatocyte death → Inflammation → **Stellate cell activation** → Collagen deposition → **Fibrosis** → Architectural distortion → Nodular regeneration → **Cirrhosis**

**Stellate cells** (key players):
- Normally quiescent, store vitamin A
- Activated by injury → myofibroblasts
- Produce collagen I and III
- Contract (increase portal pressure)

#### Etiology
- **Viral hepatitis**: HBV, HCV (most common worldwide)
- **Alcohol**: Most common in Western countries
- **Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease** (NAFLD/NASH): Increasing
- **Autoimmune**: Autoimmune hepatitis, PBC, PSC
- **Metabolic**: Hemochromatosis, Wilson disease, α1-antitrypsin deficiency
- **Biliary obstruction**: Chronic
- **Cardiac**: Chronic right heart failure
- **Drugs/toxins**
- **Cryptogenic**: Unknown (10-15%)

#### Morphology

**Gross**:
- Nodular surface (micronodular or macronodular)
- Firm, irregular
- **Micronodular** (<3 mm): Uniform small nodules
  - Alcohol, biliary disease, venous outflow obstruction
- **Macronodular** (>3 mm): Variable large nodules
  - Viral hepatitis
- **Mixed**

**Microscopic**:
- **Fibrous septa**: Bridge portal areas and central veins
- **Regenerative nodules**: Hepatocytes surrounded by fibrosis
- **Loss of normal architecture**: No central veins in nodules
- **Vascular alterations**: Shunts, sinusoidal capillarization

#### Clinical Manifestations

**Compensated cirrhosis**: Asymptomatic or minimal symptoms

- Increased resistance from fibrosis and architectural distortion
- Complications:
  - **Varices**: Esophageal (most dangerous), gastric, rectal, caput medusae
  - **Variceal hemorrhage**: Life-threatening
  - **Splenomegaly**: Congestive splenomegaly → hypersplenism
