## Introduction

Histology is the microscopic study of tissue organization and structure. Understanding tissue composition and architecture is essential for comprehending organ function, recognizing pathological changes, and interpreting clinical findings. This overview introduces the four basic tissue types, microscopy techniques, and fundamental histological concepts.

### Learning Objectives

1. Define the four basic tissue types and their general characteristics
2. Understand principles of light microscopy and tissue preparation
3. Recognize common histological stains and their applications
4. Describe the structure-function relationship in tissues
5. Apply histological knowledge to clinical scenarios

## The Four Basic Tissue Types

All organs are composed of combinations of four basic tissue types, each with distinctive structure and function.

### 1. Epithelial Tissue

**Definition**: Sheets of cells covering body surfaces, lining cavities, and forming glands.

**Characteristics:**

## Microscopy and Histological Techniques

### Light Microscopy

**Principle**: Uses visible light and glass lenses to magnify specimens.

**Components:**
- Light source (illumination)
- Condenser lens (focuses light)
- Objective lenses (magnification: 4x, 10x, 40x, 100x)
- Eyepiece (ocular lens, typically 10x)
- Stage (holds slide)

**Total Magnification**: Objective magnification × Eyepiece magnification
- Example: 40x objective × 10x eyepiece = 400x total magnification

**Resolution**: Ability to distinguish two close points as separate
- Light microscopy: ~0.2 μm resolution limit
- Depends on wavelength of light and numerical aperture

### Tissue Preparation

To visualize tissues under light microscopy, specimens must be processed:

**1. Fixation**
- **Purpose**: Preserve tissue structure, prevent degradation
- **Common fixatives**:
  - **Formalin** (10% buffered formalin): Most common
  - Glutaraldehyde: Electron microscopy
  - Alcohol: Rapid fixation
- **Mechanism**: Cross-links proteins, inactivates enzymes
- **Duration**: Hours to days (depending on size)

**2. Dehydration**
- **Purpose**: Remove water to allow paraffin infiltration
- **Process**: Series of graded alcohols (70% → 95% → 100%)
- **Why**: Paraffin is hydrophobic (water-insoluble)

**3. Clearing**
- **Purpose**: Replace alcohol with paraffin-miscible solvent
- **Agent**: Xylene (most common)
- **Makes tissue transparent** ("cleared")

**4. Embedding (Infiltration)**
- **Purpose**: Support tissue for thin sectioning
- **Medium**: Molten paraffin wax (infiltrates tissue)
- **Result**: Tissue embedded in paraffin block

**5. Sectioning**
- **Instrument**: Microtome
- **Thickness**: 5-10 μm (micrometers) for light microscopy
- **Mounting**: Sections placed on glass slides

**6. Staining**
- **Purpose**: Provide contrast (tissue components are colorless)
- **Process**: Remove paraffin (deparaffinization), rehydrate, stain
- **Multiple stains available** (see below)

**7. Mounting**
- **Purpose**: Preserve stained section
- **Process**: Apply mounting medium, cover with coverslip

### Frozen Sections

**Purpose**: Rapid diagnosis (e.g., during surgery)

**Process:**
- Fresh tissue frozen rapidly (no fixation/embedding)
- Sectioned with cryostat (refrigerated microtome)
- Stained immediately (H&E)
- **Result in 10-20 minutes** (vs. days for paraffin sections)

**Limitations:**
- Lower quality than paraffin sections
- Used when speed is critical

**Clinical Application:**
- Intraoperative diagnosis (is tumor malignant?)
- Surgical margin assessment (is tumor completely removed?)

## Histological Stains

  - ER (estrogen receptor)
  - PR (progesterone receptor)
  - HER2 (treatment decisions)
- **Infectious disease**: Identify organisms
- **Transplant rejection**: Detect antibody deposition

### Electron Microscopy (EM)

**Principle**: Uses electron beams instead of light for much higher magnification and resolution.

**Types:**

**Transmission EM (TEM):**
- Electrons pass through thin specimen
- Magnification up to 1,000,000x
- Resolution: ~0.1 nm
- Visualizes **ultrastructure** (organelles, membranes)

**Scanning EM (SEM):**

- Requires specialized expertise

## Structure-Function Relationships

A fundamental principle in histology: **Structure reflects function**.

### Examples:

**Small intestine:**
- **Villi and microvilli** → Increased surface area → Enhanced absorption

**Cardiac muscle:**
- **Intercalated discs** (gap junctions) → Electrical coupling → Synchronized contraction

**Alveoli:**
- **Thin epithelium** (type I pneumocytes) → Minimal diffusion distance → Efficient gas exchange

**Kidney glomerulus:**
- **Fenestrated capillaries** → Filtration of blood

**Liver:**
- **Sinusoidal capillaries** (discontinuous, fenestrated) → Exchange between blood and hepatocytes

**Bone:**
- **Mineralized matrix** → Structural support, calcium reservoir

Understanding these relationships enables prediction of function from structure (and vice versa).

## Clinical Histology

### Biopsy

**Definition**: Removal of tissue for microscopic examination.

**Types:**
- **Excisional**: Entire lesion removed
- **Incisional**: Part of lesion removed
- **Needle biopsy**: Core of tissue obtained
- **Fine needle aspiration (FNA)**: Cells aspirated (cytology, not histology)

**Indications:**
- Tumor diagnosis (benign vs. malignant)
- Inflammatory disease (e.g., inflammatory bowel disease)
- Infection (e.g., tuberculosis)
- Transplant rejection
- Unknown diagnosis

**Common Biopsy Sites:**

2. **Microscopic description**: Histological findings
3. **Diagnosis**: Final interpretation
4. **Additional tests**: IHC, molecular studies (if performed)
5. **Comments**: Clinical correlation, recommendations

**Cancer Reports Include:**
- Tumor type (histological classification)
- Grade (differentiation: well, moderate, poor)
- Stage (extent of spread: TNM staging)
- Margins (involvement or clearance)

## Histological Artifacts

**Definition**: Artificial structures introduced during tissue processing.

**Common Artifacts:**
- **Shrinkage**: Tissue appears smaller (dehydration)
- **Folding**: Tissue folds during sectioning
- **Tearing**: Tissue tears during sectioning
- **Knife marks**: Parallel lines from dull blade
- **Precipitate**: Stain precipitate on slide
- **Air bubbles**: Under coverslip

**Recognition**: Important to distinguish artifacts from pathology.
